## Abstract

While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, they also introduce significant safety and privacy risks. Current mitigation strategies often fail to preserve contextual reasoning capabilities in risky scenarios. Instead, they rely heavily on sensitive pattern matching to protect LLMs, which limits the scope. Furthermore, they overlook established safety and privacy standards, leading to systemic risks for legal compliance. To address these gaps, we formulate safety and privacy issues into contextualized compliance problems following the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory. Under the CI framework, we align our model with three critical regulatory standards: GDPR, EU AI Act, and HIPAA. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) with a rulebased reward to incentivize contextual reasoning capabilities while enhancing compliance with safety and privacy norms. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly enhances legal compliance (achieving a +8.58% accuracy im provement in safety/privacy benchmarks) but also further improves general reasoning capability. For OpenThinker-7B, a strong reasoning model that significantly outperforms its base model Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct across diverse sub jects, our method enhances its general reasoning capabilities, with +2.05% and +8.98% accuracy improvement on the MMLU and Legal-Bench benchmark, respectively.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and generation (Ouyang et al., 2022; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Touvron et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2025). When deploying them as powerful agents capable of interacting with a wide range of external tools (Wang et al., 2024a; Xi et al., 2023; Yim et al., 2024; Deng et al., 2025), significant trustworthiness concerns arise (Li et al., 2024d). From a safety perspective, LLMs can be exploited through techniques such as prompt injection (Liu et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2025a,b) and jailbreaking (Gu et al., 2024), leading to unauthorized or unintended tool usage. Even worse, LLMs themselves may generate unsafe content, including harmful, biased, or misleading outputs (Huang et al., 2025; Fang et al., 2024). From the privacy perspective, LLMs may leak sensitive or private information, either through memorization of training data (Carlini et al., 2021) or through inference over seemingly innocuous inputs (Li et al., 2023a).

Existing studies have attempted to address safety and privacy concerns in LLMs (Carlini et al., 2019; Li et al., 2024a; Cheng et al., 2025). Typically, conventional approaches often rely on predefined safety or privacy patterns, which only tackle isolated aspects of these challenges. In reality, both safety and privacy are context-dependent: the risk of unsafe model behavior or data leakage hinges on situational factors such as user intent, input-output dynamics, and environmental variables (Li et al., 2024b). Recently, several works have studied LLM privacy within the context (Fan et al., 2024; Cheng et al., 2024; Li et al., 2025), yet these efforts often fail to align LLMs effectively with nuanced contextual information.

A further limitation of existing approaches is that they ignore established safety and privacy standards, which often introduces systemic vulnerabilities (Yao et al., 2024). A more robust paradigm would require LLM systems to be safeguarded through systematic, legally grounded frameworks that ensure rigorous compliance. With the rapid advancement of LLM, regulatory instruments such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) have emerged as foundational standards for LLM safety and data privacy. While preliminary efforts have explored aligning LLMs with legal frameworks (Guha et al., 2023; Achintalwar et al., 2024), it still remains a significant challenge due to the comprehensiveness of laws. For instance, legal documents possess a complex hierarchical structure, and the relationships among regulations are intricate. Consequently, naively adapting existing methods of legal alignment to ensure LLM safety remains challenges.

In this work, we address safety and privacy issues in LLMs by enhancing their contextual reasoning capabilities for legal compliance. To facilitate computation based on context, we formulate LLM safety and data privacy via contextual integrity (CI) (Nissenbaum, 2009), which defines safety and privacy as contextual information flows under certain norms. With the CI framework, we are able to align LLMs with established legal frameworks, including GDPR, the EU AI Act, and HIPAA. To further strengthen contextualized compliance reasoning, we utilize a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for LLM training, where the reward is rulebased and optimizes legal compliance outcomes. This method not only improves contextualized legal compliance for solving LLM safety and privacy protection but also preserves the generalization capabilities of LLMs across diverse domains. Our contributions are summarized as follows:

1) We enhance models’ contextual understanding by formulating safety and privacy using the contextual integrity (CI) theory, enabling LLMs to better comply with established core standards, including GDPR, EU AI Act, and HIPAA.

2) We leverage reinforcement learning algorithms with rule-based rewards to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and align them with legal frameworks.

3) Through extensive experiments, we found that our method significantly improves the model’s capabilities in safety and privacy, achieving an accuracy improvement of +8.58%. Moreover, our model demonstrates strong generalization to other domains, with +2.05% and +8.98% accuracy improvement on MMLU and LegalBench.

## 2 Preliminaries

## 2.1 Contextual Integrity

Contextual Integrity (CI) (Nissenbaum, 2009) formalizes privacy within information flows governed by context-specific norms. Specifically, CI evaluates privacy through five interdependent parameters: subject, sender, recipient, information type (data attributes, context topic, or other information about privacy), and transmission principle, which can be structured into:

SENDER transmits SUBJECT’s INFORMA-TION to RECIPIENT under TRANSMISSION PRINCIPLE.

For example, in clinical research, sharing anonymized patient records from hospitals to researchers requires consent.

Formally, CI defines a context as a tuple of parameters: $\mathcal { C } : = \langle S , S _ { d } , R , I , P \rangle$ , where S = subject, S = sender, R = Recipient, I = information type, and P = transmission principles. A data flow F complies with informational norms in context C can be written as:

$$
\begin{array} { c } { { F \vdash \mathcal { C } \iff \forall ( s , s _ { d } , r , i ) \in F , \exists p \in P : } } \\ { { \qquad p ( s , s _ { d } , r , i ) = t r u e . } } \end{array}\tag{*}
$$

By further extending CI, we formulate safety and privacy as information flows, enabling contextualized compliance reasoning in LLMs.

## 2.2 AI Safety and Privacy Regulations

Several legal frameworks have been established to regulate LLM systems and protect data privacy. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the EU’s cornerstone for personal data protection, mandating principles such as lawfulness, fairness, transparency, and data minimization. The EU AI Act, as the first comprehensive regulatory proposal targeting AI systems, introduces a risk-based classification and enforces obligations such as robustness, transparency, and human oversight for high-risk AI. In the healthcare domain, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States governs the privacy and security of individuals’ medical information, with strict rules for access and disclosure. In this work, we align LLMs with rigorous regulations under these three regulatory frameworks, integrating their core legal principles to promote lawful, safe, and privacy-preserving LLM systems.

## 2.3 Reinforcement Learning for LLMs

Reinforcement learning (RL) significantly enhances the reasoning and generalization capabilities of LLMs (Wang et al., 2024b; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Cui et al., 2025). Typically, RL-trained

![](images/a771b9a41afcba1ec7e6b37b3ca2003eff0bbd1a59f78bc4e1d76c76c900d320.jpg)  
Figure 1: First, we prepare structured regulations and legal cases stored in a database. Next, we perform distillation across HIPAA, GDPR, and the EU AI Act using DeepSeek-R1, filtered by a meticulously designed legal verifier. Finally, after cold starting on the distilled reasoning trajectories, we train a reinforcement learning model to improve reasoning over contextualized legal compliance.

LLMs optimized for logical reasoning tasks exhibit strong generalization across diverse domains. Current RL frameworks for LLMs utilize two reward paradigms: rule-based and neural-based. Rulebased rewards (Xie et al., 2025; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Kimi et al., 2025) are well-suited for deterministic tasks, where outputs can be validated via verifiers or compilers. Otherwise, neuralbased reward models can be leveraged for RL training (Ouyang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023b; Yin et al., 2025). In this work, we design rule-based rewards for RL training by leveraging legal compliance outcomes, enabling generalization across various safety, privacy, or even general domains.

## 3 Protecting LLM Safety and Privacy via Enhancing Contextualized Reasoning

In this section, we demonstrate our method. The overall workflow is shown in Figure 1. We protect LLM safety and privacy by aligning LLMs with relevant laws under the contextual integrity (CI) framework for better legal compliance. This is achieved by incentivizing contextual reasoning through a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm.

## 3.1 Comprehensive Data Structure for Legal Alignment under CI framework

To improve legal alignment, we first construct a hierarchical regulation structure and a context-aware legal case database. Initially, the regulations are gathered from official sources, and real legal cases are sourced from PrivaCI-Bench (Li et al., 2025).

Hierarchical Regulation Structure. A critical challenge for legal alignment remains in intricate relationships among regulations. To address this issue, we structuralize regulations from the GDPR, EU AI Act, and HIPAA, where each law consists of several hierarchies. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 1, in the GDPR, we organize regulations into a hierarchy that includes chapters, articles, and points. The hierarchical system enables LLMs to efficiently retrieve essential regulations for compliance. Additionally, this structure enhances reasoning capabilities by learning the relationships among different regulations.

Context-aware Legal Case Database. Though PrivaCI-Bench offers CI annotations related to legal cases, challenges persist in extrapolating roles and attributes in the information flow of these cases for regulatory alignment and generalization. To address this issue, we have developed a comprehensive knowledge graph based on triplets of sender, subject, and receiver, grounded in contextual integrity theory. This knowledge graph serves as a context-aware database for legal cases.

## 3.2 Cold Starting Reasoning Models

Another important aspect is to cold-start the reasoning capability on legal compliance. We leverage DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) to distill high-quality reasoning trajectories for legal compliance on cases, across GDPR, EU AI Act, and HIPAA. Specifically, we meticulously design legal compliance questions for various cases and query the DeepSeek-R1 model. The response from DeepSeek-R1 will be validated by our verifier for case relevance and legal compliance. The validated response from DeepSeek-R1 comprises two parts: a thinking chain and a solution. We collect both the thinking and the solution, then integrate them into the CI framework, carefully designed as:

```erb
<|begin_of_thought|>
[thinking chain]
<|end_of_thought|>
<CI>
[contextual integrity parameters]
<\CI>
<|begin_of_solution|>
[solution and result]
<|end_of_solution|>
```

Under this framework, we cold-start LLMs on the distilled reasoning trajectories to initialize contextual reasoning and legal alignment. Specifically, we utilize supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as the coldstart training strategy.

## 3.3 Incentivizing Reasoning for Safety and Privacy with RL

We leverage Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017b), a reinforcement learning algorithm, to train our models and incentivize reasoning capabilities for LLM safety and privacy. Based on the cold-started model, we conduct PPO training using a rule-based reward model. The reward is based on the compliance result of the corresponding legal case, parsed from the solution part of the reasoning trajectories. If the legal compliance result from the model is correct, the reward is +1; otherwise, it is 0. The rule-based reward model can be formulated as:

$$
R ( s , a ) = \mathbb { I } ( \{ s , a \} { \mathrm { i s ~ c o m p l i a n t } } ) ,\tag{1}
$$

where $R ( s , a )$ represents the reward associated with a legal compliance question s and a reasoning trajectory a. We optimize:

$$
\arg \operatorname* { m a x } _ { \theta } \mathbb { E } _ { s \sim \mathcal { D } , a \sim \pi _ { \theta } ( \cdot | s ) } \left[ R ( s , a ) \right] ,\tag{2}
$$

where θ represents the model weights of the LLMs, D denotes the state space within the distribution of legal cases, and $\pi _ { \boldsymbol { \theta } } ( \cdot | s )$ is the action space for legal compliance given a legal case question.

Through RL training, incentivized by a legal compliance reward, our model can perform comprehensive contextualized reasoning on legal cases, aligning precisely with regulations under the CI framework. This approach systematically safeguards LLM safety and data privacy under established standards.

## 4 Experimental Settings

In this section, we will describe our experimental settings in detail.

## 4.1 Legal Compliance Data

We utilize legal compliance cases from PrivaCI-Bench (Li et al., 2025), a comprehensive benchmark that includes 6,348 comprehensive real cases across domains of GDPR, EU AI Act, and HIPAA, where the statistics details are shown in Table 3. These cases encompass various issues, including AI system misuse and data privacy breaches. To facilitate training and evaluation, we integrate legal cases into legal questions, using the question template provided in Appendix B. Besides, we divide the data into training and testing sets with a ratio of 8:2.

Furthermore, we store these legal cases in our context-aware case database, organized into three categories: EU AI Act, GDPR, and HIPAA. Specifically, for the context-aware legal case database, we extend the knowledge graphs of roles and attributes proposed in PrivaCI-Bench and integrate them into the contextual integrity framework. This comprehensive knowledge graph includes 268k sender-subject-recipient triplets, constructed by GPT-4o (OpenAI et al., 2024).

## 4.2 LLM Models

We utilize two baseline models: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025) and OpenThinker-7B (OpenThoughts, 2025). OpenThinker-7B is based on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and has been supervised fine-tuned (SFT) using OpenThought-114k (OpenThoughts, 2025), which comprises 114,000 high-quality STEM reasoning trajectories distilled from DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). This model significantly enhances reasoning capabilities for STEM questions and generalizes well to diverse logical reasoning domains. We leave details of OpenThinker-7B in Appendix B.

For our models, we first cold start OpenThinker-7B on 5,080 legal compliance reasoning trajectories distilled from DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025), where the seed data are originated from the training set. Based on this cold-started model, we train a reinforcement learning (RL) model on the same legal case set. We follow the method in Section 3, with experimental details:

OpenThinker-7B-SFT. We distill reasoning trajectories from DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) by posing legal compliance questions and verifying the response. Then, we gather the verified reasoning trajectories along with compliance results and cold start OpenThinker-7B on them through supervised fine-tuned (SFT).

OpenThinker-7B-PPO (training PPO on

OpenThinker-7B-SFT). For reinforcement learning training, we choose the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm (Schulman et al., 2017b). We train PPO on OpenThinker-7B-SFT using a rulebased reward, where the legal compliance results serve as the reward.

The relationships among these four models can be clarified by presenting:

Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct   
+ OpenThoughts-114k ⇒ OpenThinker-7B   
+ Cold Start (Ours) ⇒ OpenThinker-7B-SFT   
+ PPO (Ours) ⇒ OpenThinker-7B-PPO  
Table 4: Relationships among different models.

## 4.3 Training Details

We train our model using the OpenRLHF training framework (Hu et al., 2024) with 8 NVIDIA H800 80GB GPUs. For supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we set the learning rate to 5e-6, the batch size to 1, and the maximum token length to 4,096. For PPO training, the learning rates for the actor and critic are set to 5e-7 and 9e-6, respectively. The batch size is 2, with a maximum token length of 2,048 for both prompting and rolling out, and the KL coefficient is set to 1e-2. To demonstrate the RL training process, we illustrate training curves in Appendix C.

## 4.4 Evaluation Tasks and Metrics

We evaluate LLM safety and data privacy by comparing our models with baselines across three dimensions: legal compliance, contextual understanding, and generalization capability.

Legal Compliance. We evaluate the models on legal compliance questions from the testing set of legal cases described in Section 4.1. Each legal compliance question determines whether the case is permitted, prohibited, or not applicable under a specific regulation. We use accuracy as the evaluation metric.

Figure 2: Ablation studies for the legal compliance task. All results are evaluated in %. w.o. stands for without. Qwen refers to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct.

Contextual Understanding. Based on legal cases in the testing set, we design 5,844 multiplechoice questions (MCQs) focused on contextual integrity parameters, such as roles and attributes. An example question might be, “What is the sender in the legal case?” Each question includes four choices, with one correct answer, where misleading options are semantically similar to the correct answer. We also use accuracy as the evaluation metric. We leave the MCQ details in Appendix A. Generalization Capability. We evaluate LLMs’ generalization capability across a wide range of legal domains, including LegalBench (Guha et al., 2023) and LawBench (Fei et al., 2023). Legal-Bench consists of 162 tasks that evaluate various aspects of legal reasoning, using balanced accuracy as the evaluation metric. LawBench focuses on Chinese laws and contains 20 diverse legal tasks. On LawBench, we concentrate on two challenging tasks of charge prediction and prison term prediction, employing F1 score and normalized log distance as evaluation metrics, respectively.

Furthermore, to evaluate the truthfulness of LLMs, an important aspect of their trustworthiness, we test models using the TruthfulQA benchmark (Lin et al., 2022). TruthfulQA includes 817 questions across 38 categories, such as health, law, finance, and politics. We take accuracy as the evaluation metric for TruthfulQA.

To further evaluate generalization to general domains, we test the LLMs on the Measuring Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021), which in-

cludes 57 tasks across a wide variety of domains.   
We use accuracy as the evaluation metric.

## 5 Experimental Results

To comprehensively evaluate LLM safety and data privacy, we compare our models with baselines along three dimensions: legal compliance, contextual understanding, and generalization capability. Furthermore, we conduct thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of each part in training ingredients.

## 5.1 Legal Compliance

We evaluate legal compliance on legal case questions, demonstrated in Table 1. The results suggest the following findings.

1) Continuous finetuning reasoning models on reasoning trajectories oflegal compliance can lead to further improvement. By cold starting on reasoning trajectories from DeepSeek-R1, our model, OpenThinker-7B-SFT, achieves exceptional performance with an accuracy of 87.36%. This surpasses baseline models, including Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct at 70.65%, OpenThinker-7B at 79.71%, and DeepSeek-R1 at 86.52%. OpenThinker-7B-PPO can further improve performance through PPO training on OpenThinker-7B-SFT, achieving the highest accuracy of 88.29%. We also conduct extensive experiments on the Qwen family to consolidate our findings, provided in Appendix C.

Ablation Studies. To further investigate the effectiveness of our training ingredients, we conduct thorough ablation studies, shown in Figure 2. We take Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct as the baseline model. The training ingredients include: ①

<table><tr><td>Models</td><td>Interpretation</td><td>Issue</td><td>Rhetorical</td><td>Rule</td><td>All</td><td>Improvement</td></tr><tr><td>OpenThinker-7B</td><td>83.58</td><td>65.29</td><td>77.85</td><td>55.14</td><td>63.54</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>OpenThinker-7B-SFT (Ours)</td><td>88.45</td><td>69.12</td><td>79.45</td><td>61.98</td><td>69.67</td><td>+6.13</td></tr><tr><td>OpenThinker-7B-PPO (Ours)</td><td>88.83</td><td>69.22</td><td>79.54</td><td>61.88</td><td>72.52</td><td>+8.98</td></tr></table>

Table 5: LegalBench results. We take balanced accuracy as the evaluation metric (reported in %).

Figure 3: Lawbench (Chinese law) results. Evaluation metrics for charge prediction and prison term prediction are F1 score and normalized log distance (both in %).

SFT on OpenThoughts-114k, ② SFT on legal compliance reasoning trajectories (i.e. cold starting), and ③ PPO training on legal compliance results. The relationships among these training ingredients have been shown in Table 4. We enumerate all possible combinations of the three ingredients for model training. For the newly introduced notations, Qwen-SFT and Qwen-PPO are trained under settings similar to those for OpenThinker-7B. The term “w.o. cold start” means training PPO without cold starting on reasoning trajectories.

In all settings, we find that a cold start is crucial for enhancing legal compliance. Additionally, PPO training on cold-started models can further boost performance. In many settings of PPO training without a cold start, performance can also be enhanced. For instance, under the setting of Qwen-PPO without a cold start, there is a notable improvement of +20.34% on EU AI Act.

## 5.2 Contextual Understanding

We assess LLMs’ contextual understanding by creating challenging multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that focus on identifying contextual integrity parameters. By analyzing the results shown in Table 2, we can draw the following findings.

![](images/b51e90bb5e32db6f5fdca12bacb670d7f7cf3bb84ded48d6b2ab5a7c02d012b2.jpg)  
Figure 4: TruthfulQA results. The evaluation metric is accuracy. All results are evaluated in %.

2) Reasoning models finetuning on STEM reasoning trajectories cannot generalize well to contextual reasoning. After supervised fine-tuning on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct with STEM domain reasoning data, OpenThinker-7B experienced a decrease in average MCQ accuracy from 72.17% to 60.69%, with a drop of -11.48%.

3) Aligning LLMs with legal compliance under the contextual integrity framework can significantly enhance contextual understanding. After coldstarting OpenThinker-7B with legal compliance reasoning trajectories, our model OpenThinker-7B-SFT achieved an accuracy of 71.75%, with an improvement of +11.06%. Furthermore, our model OpenThinker-7B-PPO reaches an even greater accuracy of 75.33%, with an improvement of +14.64%, surpassing Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct by +3.16%.

## 5.3 Generalization Capability

We further demonstrate the generalization capability of our methods. We conduct tests on Legal-Bench (Guha et al., 2023), LawBench (Fei et al., 2023), TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2022) and MMLU benchmark (Hendrycks et al., 2021). We have the following findings.

4) Aligning with AI safety and data privacy laws via enhancing contextualized legal compliance can generalize effectively across a wide range of legal domains, even including laws in other languages. As shown in Table 5, on LegalBench, our models OpenThinker-7B-SFT and OpenThinker-7B-PPO surpass OpenThinker-7B, achieving improvements of +6.13% and +8.98% in balanced accuracy, respectively. Additionally, our models demonstrate superior results across all subtopics, including interpretation, issue, rhetorical, and rule in LegalBench. Furthermore, our models can generalize to the Chinese law benchmark, LawBench. On LawBench, as shown in Figure 3, our model achieves improvements of +6.60% in charge prediction and +9.24% in prison term prediction tasks, respectively.

5) Reasoning capability on contextualized compliance can be generalized to enhance the truthfulness of LLMs. As illustrated in Figure 4, our models OpenThinker-7B-SFT and OpenThinker-7B-PPO both generalize well to TruthfulQA, achieving an average accuracy improvement of +2.04%. This represents an enhancement in the truthfulness of LLMs, a crucial aspect of LLM safety.

6) Contextualized legal alignment can even generalize effectively to the general domain, achieving improvements on the MMLU benchmark. As described in Section 4.4, the MMLU benchmark covers a wide range of domains with 57 tasks. As shown in Table 6, our models OpenThinker-7B-SFT and OpenThinker-7B-PPO can both achieve an accuracy of 70.47%, with a +2.05% improvement. Our models also show superior performance on all sub-domains, including humanities, social science, STEM, and others.

## 6 Related Works

## 6.1 LLM Safety and Data Privacy

Research on the safety and privacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) has gained significant attention in recent years. Studies have identified various attack methods, including jailbreaking (Chao et al., 2024; Shen et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023a), data poisoning (Steinhardt et al., 2017; Tolpegin et al., 2020; Schwarzschild et al., 2021), and membership inference attacks (Shokri et al., 2017; Carlini et al., 2022). Even worse, LLMs can generate harmful or biased content (Li et al., 2024c; Fang et al., 2024; Lee and Seong, 2025). Mitigation strategies have also been explored, such as implementing differential privacy techniques to obscure sensitive training data (Behnia et al., 2022; Yu et al., 2022; Ponomareva et al., 2023) and enhance model robustness against adversarial inputs (Zou et al., 2023; Xhonneux et al., 2024). However, these approaches often predefine specific safety or privacy patterns, highlighting the need for a systematic safeguard aligned with established standards.

## 6.2 Privacy and Contextual Integrity in LLM era

There are works that address LLM privacy issues using contextual integrity (CI) theory. Privacy Checklist (Li et al., 2024b) converts privacy essentials into a checklist for understanding contextdependent norms. GOLDCOIN (Fan et al., 2024) grounds LLMs in privacy laws, generating scenarios to identify privacy risks. CI-Bench (Cheng et al., 2024) provides a synthetic-data benchmark for AI assistants’ protection of personal information. LLM-CI (Shvartzshnaider and Duddu, 2025) offers an open-source framework to assess privacy norms using CI-based methods. PrivaCI-Bench (Li et al., 2025) evaluates LLMs’ adherence to CI norms. Meanwhile, a study (Mireshghallah et al., 2024) reveals that LLMs often violate contextual privacy norms, and another study (Ghalebikesabi et al., 2024) builds a CI framework for AI assistants. Compared to existing works, our method achieves precise legal alignment within the CI framework, significantly enhancing contextualized legal compliance reasoning to ensure that LLMs adhere to established standards. To further illustrate the advancements of our framework for legal alignment, we provide a case study on the compliance process, detailed in Appendix C.

## 7 Conclusion

In conclusion, our work systematically protects the safety and privacy of LLMs by aligning them with established standards, including the GDPR, the EU AI Act, and HIPAA, grounded in contextual integrity theory. Specifically, we utilize a reinforcement learning algorithm to enhance contextualized legal reasoning, using compliance results as rewards. Beyond legal reasoning, our method enhances generalization capabilities in general domains, as proved by our extensive experiments.

When LLMs represent significant advancements across a wide range of applications, the importance of LLM safety and privacy continues to grow. We believe our work can provide valuable insights into mitigating systemic risks in LLMs.

## Limitations

Our method aligns LLMs with established safety and privacy laws to enhance legal compliance. We do not address the alignment and potential conflicts between different regulations. For instance, entities governed by both the GDPR and the EU AI Act must navigate compliance with both laws by resolving their conflicts and ensuring alignment. However, this issue is beyond the scope of our paper. We primarily propose a novel approach to legal alignment for LLM safety and privacy by enhancing their contextualized compliance reasoning capabilities. Addressing conflicts and alignments between laws is a crucial practical concern and will be an important focus for future research in the community.

## Ethical Considerations

We affirm that all authors of this paper acknowledge the ACL Code of Conduct. We propose a novel framework for enhancing LLM safety and privacy by improving contextualized compliance reasoning through reinforcement learning. We believe our method will establish a new paradigm for protecting LLM safety and privacy.

Legal Case Data. The legal cases used for model training and evaluation are public court cases that have been granted fair use, collected by PrivaCI-Bench (Li et al., 2025).

Potential Risks. Our method has significantly enhanced model performance regarding legal compliance in cases related to LLM safety and privacy. However, some failure cases still remain, which could be exploited by malicious adversaries to study these failure behaviors. This highlights the need for future efforts from the community to address these challenges.

## A Statistics Details

MCQs on Contextual Understanding. We meticulously designed 5,844 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on their contextual understanding. Each question includes four options, one of which is correct. The questions focus on contextual integrity parameters, including sender, recipient, subject, and information attributes. To enhance the challenge of the MCQs, we crafted three misleading choices that are semantically close to the correct answer using a BERT-based sentence embedding model (Devlin et al., 2019). Detailed statistics are presented in Table 7.

## B Experiments Details

OpenThinker-7B Details. We developed our models, OpenThinker-7B-SFT and OpenThinker-7B-PPO, based on OpenThinker-7B (OpenThoughts, 2025).

<table><tr><td>Source</td><td>Domain</td><td>Number</td></tr><tr><td>numina_math</td><td>math</td><td>89,120</td></tr><tr><td>code_contests</td><td>code</td><td>6,510</td></tr><tr><td>apps</td><td>code</td><td>4,794</td></tr><tr><td>taco</td><td>code</td><td>6,983</td></tr><tr><td>codeforces</td><td>code</td><td>1,617</td></tr><tr><td>camelai_biology</td><td>biology</td><td>1,246</td></tr><tr><td>camelai_physics</td><td>physics</td><td>1,246</td></tr><tr><td>camelai_chemistry</td><td>chemistry</td><td>1,222</td></tr><tr><td>riddle_sense</td><td>puzzle</td><td>1,219</td></tr></table>

Table 8: OpenThought-114k’s statistical details.

OpenThinker-7B is a robust, open-sourced reasoning model based on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (Qwen et al., 2025), and has been supervised fine-tuned on a comprehensive STEM dataset, OpenThought-114k. This dataset consists of reasoning trajectories distilled from DeepSeek-R1, including high-quality STEM questions collected from well-known datasets by the OpenThought team. After distillation, the reasoning trajectories were verified by a carefully designed verifier, reducing the original

173k samples to 114k. These trajectories cover a wide range of STEM questions, with statistical details presented in Table 8. By fine-tuning on these reasoning trajectories, OpenThinker-7B has achieved superior performance across various logical reasoning domains, as shown in Table 9.

<table><tr><td>Model</td><td>Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct</td><td>OpenThinker-7B</td></tr><tr><td>AIME24</td><td>13.3</td><td>31.3</td></tr><tr><td>AIME25</td><td>9.9</td><td>23.3</td></tr><tr><td>MATH500</td><td>71.0</td><td>83.2</td></tr><tr><td>GPQA-D</td><td>23.5</td><td>42.9</td></tr></table>

Table 9: Comparisons between Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and OpenThinker-7B. AIME24, AIME25, and MATH500 consist of math questions, while GPQA-D includes questions from biology, physics, and chemistry. All results are reported in %.

LLM Generation Settings. For Deepseek-R1, we adhered to the default settings. For other models, we configured the following parameters: max\_new\_tokens set to 2048, temperature to 0.2, and max\_retry to 5.

Prompt Templates. Prompt templates for legal compliance questions and MCQs are shown in Table 17. In this table, we also show the system prompt for OpenThinker-7B, OpenThinker-7B-SFT, and OpenThinker-7B-PPO. This system prompt is provided by the official OpenThought team (OpenThoughts, 2025).

Computation Resources. In our experiment, we utilized 8 NVIDIA H800 GPUs to train and evaluate our models and baseline models, requiring a total of 1 month of GPU hours to finish all experiments. The overall cost for distilling DeepSeek-R1 using API calls amounted to approximately \$100 USD.

Examples of Legal Cases. We provide some examples of legal cases from GDPR, HIPAA, and the EU AI Act, as shown in Table 18. These cases originate from PrivaCi-Bench (Li et al., 2025).

Normalized Log Distance. We utilize normalized log distance for the prison term prediction task in LawBench (Fei et al., 2023). We calculate the logarithm of the difference between the extracted answer and the gold standard answer, then normalize it to a range of 0 to 1 for improved compatibility with other metrics.

## C More Evaluation Results

Legal Compliance Results on Qwen Family. We expanded our experiments on the Qwen family, with results presented in Tables 10 and 11. Our method significantly enhances legal compliance across all settings, achieving accuracy improvements of: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct (+21.59%), Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct (+35.67%), and Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct (+16.50%); for the Qwen3 series: Qwen3-0.6B (+5.74%), Qwen3-4B (+3.07%), and Qwen3-8B (+1.85%).

MMLU Results on Qwen3-0.6B. Furthermore, we evaluate Qwen3-0.6B on MMLU benchmarks (Hendrycks et al., 2021). As demonstrated in Table 14, our model, Qwen3-0.6B-SFT, achieves improved performance with an accuracy of 40.42%, surpassing the base model’s accuracy of 40.24%. Additionally, Qwen3-0.6B-PPO further enhances this result, reaching an accuracy of 40.54%.

Winogrande Results. We further extend our generalization evaluation to the Winogrande benchmark (Sakaguchi et al., 2019), which evaluates natural language understanding models.

Ablation Studies for CI and RL. We have provided a comprehensive ablation study on training ingredients in Section 5.1. In this part, we additionally conduct an ablation study to differentiate the contribution of CI and RL. The experiments are conducted under the following settings: (1) Removing RL: We prepare SFT data containing CI tuple structures; (2) Removing CI: We train RL model without incorporating CI elements; (3) CI+RL: We take the exact setting used in the main experiment. As demonstrated in Table 15, models under the CI+RL setting achieve the best performance.

Balanced Training Samples. We have further investigated the result variance across different domains. We build a balanced set by randomly sampling 300 data points from each class in the training set for both in GDPR and EU AI Act. As shown in Table 16, we find that the results do not deviate much from those reported in the main experiment.

<table><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Settings</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>GDPR</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>AI ACT</td></tr><tr><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>Results on the Balanced SetResults on the Whole Set</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>90.1292.19</td><td rowspan=1 colspan=1>84.1684.33</td></tr></table>

Table 16: Results on a balanced dataset.

We observe that the results regarding the EU AI Act are relatively low. We suspect this is due to the EU AI Act being relatively new, leading to a scarcity of real-world cases. As a result, open-source models may not have encountered much information about this framework.

Reasoning Trajectory Length. We further investigate response length of reasoning trajectories across Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, OpenThinker-7B, OpenThinker-7B-SFT (Ours), and OpenThinker-7B-PPO (Ours). As shown in Table 13, the average token length of OpenThinker-7B (1,424.16) exceeds that of Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (124.27) and our models, with SFT at 609.98 and PPO at 595.17. This indicates that our model can reason about legal compliance more efficiently and with better performance. Additionally, across various domains, the EU AI Act necessitates a greater number of tokens for legal compliance checks, highlighting the complexity of the task.

PPO Training Curves. We also present the PPO training curves illustrated in Figure 5. These curves reflect the performance of the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-PPO and OpenThinker-7B-PPO settings, with or without cold starting. We report on reward, response length, and KL-divergence throughout the training process. Our findings indicate a consistent increase in rewards over time, and response lengths initially decrease before rising again. Notably, our PPO training curves in the legal compliance domain are similar to those observed in RL training within math domains (Zeng et al., 2025).

Case Studies on Reasoning Trajectories. We present examples of reasoning trajectories related to legal compliance and multiple-choice questions (MCQs), as illustrated in Tables 19 and 20, respectively. We will analyze the example of the legal compliance reasoning trajectory:

The reasoning trajectory effectively breaks down the event into three key violations of GDPR. First, it identifies the absence of a joint controllership agreement, highlighting the lack of accountability required under Article 26. Next, it emphasizes the lack of a legal basis for data collection, referencing Article 6, which is crucial for lawful processing. Finally, it addresses the failure to comply with the right to erasure as outlined in Article 17. This structured analysis clearly leads to the conclusion that the actions are prohibited under GDPR. Overall, the reasoning is logical and comprehensive, covering all critical aspects of compliance.

## D Proximal Policy Optimization

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017b) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes policies in a stable and efficient manner. It is particularly noted for balancing exploration and exploitation while ensuring that updates to the policy do not deviate excessively from the previous policy. This stability is crucial during training, as it helps prevent drastic changes that could destabilize learning.

At its core, PPO focuses on maximizing an expected return defined by the objective function:

$$
J ( \theta ) = \mathbb { E } _ { \tau \sim \pi _ { \theta } } \left[ \sum _ { t = 0 } ^ { T } r _ { t } \right]\tag{3}
$$

Here, $r _ { t }$ represents the reward at time step t, and τ denotes a trajectory of states, actions, and rewards. The policy $\pi _ { \boldsymbol { \theta } } ( a | s )$ specifies the probability

of taking action a given state s, parameterized by θ. The goal is to adjust these parameters to enhance performance.

To facilitate optimization, PPO employs a surrogate objective function, expressed as:

$$
\mathbb { E } _ { t } \left[ \operatorname* { m i n } \left( r _ { t } ( \theta ) \hat { A } _ { t } , \operatorname { c l i p } ( r _ { t } ( \theta ) , 1 - \epsilon , 1 + \epsilon ) \hat { A } _ { t } \right) \right]\tag{4}
$$

In this equation, the probability ratio $r _ { t } ( \theta )$ is defined as:

$$
r _ { t } ( \theta ) = \frac { \pi _ { \theta } ( a _ { t } | s _ { t } ) } { \pi _ { \theta _ { \mathrm { o l d } } } ( a _ { t } | s _ { t } ) }\tag{5}
$$

The estimated advantage $\hat { A } _ { t }$ is typically computed using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) (Schulman et al., 2018), which helps balance bias and variance in the estimation process. The clipping mechanism ensures that updates remain within a defined range, mitigating the risk of large, destabilizing changes.

The algorithm proceeds through several steps: first, it collects trajectories by interacting with the environment using the current policy. Next, it computes the advantages for these trajectories and finally optimizes the policy parameters θ by maximizing the surrogate objective in Equation 4 through stochastic gradient ascent. PPO’s design offers several advantages, including enhanced stability due to the clipping mechanism and simplicity in implementation compared to other methods such as Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) (Schulman et al., 2017a). These characteristics contribute to $\mathrm { P P O ^ { \circ } s }$ popularity in various applications, ranging from robotics to large language model (LLM) finetuning, making it a cornerstone technique in modern reinforcement learning.

Let me start by recalling what a &quot;sender&quot; typically refers to in data protection contexts, like GDPR. The scenario says a real estate company collected personal data without a joint controllership agreement, no legal basis, and didnt delete data when asked. The options are A: Real Estate Company, B: Concrete Contractor, C: Manager of a Real Estate Co-Ownership, D: Real Estate Agent. First, the key here is understanding the roles. The company is collecting data. Even though they didnt have a joint</td></tr><tr><td>controllership agreement, the main action is the collection by the real estate company itself. Joint controllership would involve two or more parties sharing control over data processing, but since thereś none mentioned here, the company is acting alone. Also, the company didnt have a legal basis, which means they werent compliant with GDPRś requirements for lawful</td></tr><tr><td>processing. But the question isnt about compliance; itś about identifying the sender. The sender in data protection terms usually refers to the entity that initiates the transmission of personal data. So if the company is the one collecting the data, they are the sender. Looking at the options, A is the real estate company. The other options are possible related entities, but the scenario specifically mentions the company as the one collecting data. The other roles (contractor, manager, agent) might be involved</td></tr></table>
