## Abstract

Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video, audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning – each stage targeting a distinct challenge in multimodal reasoning: representation quality, crossmodal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized Audio–Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks – including egocentric and exocentric tasks – show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5% and 8.0% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4% boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming SOTA baselines by 50.23%. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/BASHLab/RAVEN.

## 1 Introduction

Answering natural language questions in multimodal settings often requires reasoning over visual, auditory, and sensor inputs to extract the most relevant evidence (Wanniarachchi and Misra, 2025). Yet real-world signals are rarely clean or aligned:

off-camera speech, background noise, and unobserved motion can introduce conflicts across modalities. Without identifying which inputs are relevant to the question, fusion models may attend to irrelevant signals and overlook critical evidence.

We introduce RAVEN, a unified architecture for question answering over video, audio, and sensor inputs. It resolves cross-modal conflicts by reasoning about modality relevance. At its core is QuART, a query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance scores to each token. These scores suppress distractors and amplify informative signals before fusion, enabling the model to produce context-sensitive representations grounded in the question.

This challenge intensifies with sensor data integration. Unlike visual and auditory streams, sensor inputs capture latent physical dynamics, such as acceleration, orientation, and velocity, but often arrive asynchronously, are noisy, and lack semantic anchors. Their relevance also varies by question. For instance, when asked “Did the user place the object gently?”, only audio (e.g., impact sound) and motion traces (e.g., deceleration) are informative, while visual frames may mislead. QuART’s query-conditioned filtering allows the model to focus on such signals while ignoring irrelevant tokens. Figure 1 illustrates this behavior and highlights the resulting performance gains.

Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled perceptionlanguage reasoning by combining pretrained LLMs with modality-specific encoders and fusion strategies (Liu et al., 2023a; Lin et al., 2023a; Chu et al., 2023). Models such as Flamingo (Awadalla et al., 2023), Video-LLaMA (Zhang et al., 2023a), and AVicuna (Tang et al., 2024) have achieved strong results on video captioning, video QA, and audiolanguage tasks (Li et al., 2023a; Yu et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2024b). However, these systems typically focus on vision and audio, ignoring embedded sensor modalities that are critical in domains like AR/VR, robotics, and mobile health. Moreover, they often assume clean, synchronized inputs and rely on projection, cross-attention (Ye et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024; Chowdhury et al., 2025), or contrastive alignment (Radford et al., 2021; Elizalde et al., 2023) —approaches that break down under modality misalignment. In contrast, RAVEN uses queryconditioned token-level filtering via QuART to dynamically attend to the most informative modality stream at each timestep.

Figure 1: RAVEN jointly interprets video, audio, and sensor signals (e.g., inertial measurement unit or IMU) to answer fine-grained, context-aware questions. It outperforms existing MLLMs across six QA benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization through multi-modal alignment.

We train RAVEN using a three-stage pipeline: (1) unimodal pretraining to improve encoder specialization, (2) query-aligned fusion to teach relevance modeling, and (3) disagreement-oriented fine-tuning to increase robustness under modality mismatch. Each stage addresses a distinct challenge in multimodal reasoning, yielding an average 26.87% improvement over training without disagreement-oriented fine-tuning.

To support training and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K automatically generated {Audio, Video, Sensor, QA} quadruples from egocentric scenarios. To our knowledge, it is the first large-scale QA benchmark with synchronized input streams and question–answer supervision across all three modalities (See Table 1).

RAVEN, powered by QuART, achieves stateof-the-art performance on seven QA benchmarks, with gains of up to 14.5% over VideoLLaVA (Lin et al., 2023a) and 8.0% over AVicuna (Tang et al., 2024) on egocentric and exocentric tasks, respectively. Incorporating sensor data yields an additional 16.4% boost, and under modality corruption, RAVEN retains a 50.23% improvement over prior systems-demonstrating robust, query-aware reasoning across diverse multimodal inputs. We summarize our contributions below:

We propose RAVEN, a unified QA model that integrates video, audio, and sensor inputs using QuART, a query-conditioned gating module to filter distractors before fusion

Introduction of query-aligned fusion and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning after unimodal pre-training enhances representation, relevance, and robustness to cross-modal disagreement.

We release AVS-QA, a 300K-sample dataset with synchronized audio, video, sensor streams, and auto-generated QA pairs.

We achieve state-of-the-art results on seven benchmarks, with strong performance across egocentric, exocentric, and corrupted-input settings.

Figure 2: Overview of the AVS-QA dataset pipeline. Given synchronized audio–video–sensor input, the Actor generates metadata and QA pairs, the Evaluator filters weakly grounded examples, and the Critic ranks quality across five axes. The process is fully automated and yields 300K high-quality QA examples across four types.

## 2 Related Work

Large and Multi-modal Language Models. Large language models (LLMs) such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities. Multi-modal language models (MLLMs) extend LLMs with modality-specific encoders and fusion modules for visual or auditory inputs (Li et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2023a; Bai et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Chu et al., 2024; Kong et al., 2024). Representative models such as Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023a), and Video-LLaMA (Zhang et al., 2023a) achieve impressive results on vision-language and audiovideo QA through instruction tuning. However, these systems typically ignore embedded sensor modalities and assume synchronized, clean inputs. Sensor-aware models–such as LLMSense (Ouyang and Srivastava, 2024), IMUGPT (Leng et al., 2024), and OpenSQA/LLASA (Imran et al., 2024)–process inertial signals in isolation, without visual or auditory grounding. ImageBind (Girdhar et al., 2023) supports multiple modalities but lacks QA supervision or cross-modal reasoning. In contrast, our framework performs query-guided alignment across video, audio, and sensor inputs with direct QA grounding. See Appendix A for full citations.

Multi-modal Feature Alignment. Token-level fusion across modalities is central to MLLM performance. Dual encoders like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and fusion-based models such as LLaVA (Liu et al., 2023a) and Q-Former (Li et al., 2023b) align vision and language. Extensions like Hierarchical Q-Former (Azad et al., 2025), Smaug (Lin et al., 2023b), and MACAW (Lyu et al., 2023) adapt this to temporal signals but are optimized for audio-visual tasks. These approaches struggle under sensor-specific noise, asynchrony, or modality mismatch. Our proposed QuART assigns query-conditioned scalar weights to crossmodal tokens, enabling selective fusion and robust reasoning under disagreement.

Multi-modal Datasets. Existing corpora support audio-visual (e.g., HowTo100M (Chen et al., 2024b), AudioCaps (Kim et al., 2019)) and imagelanguage learning (e.g., CC3M (Changpinyo et al., 2021)). QA-focused datasets such as AVQA (Yang et al., 2022), MusicAVQA (Li et al., 2022), and MSRVTT-QA (Xu et al., 2016) do not include sensor data. Egocentric QA datasets like Ego4D (Grauman et al., 2022) and EgoTaskQA (Jia et al., 2022) lack synchronized video-audio-sensor input. To address this, we introduce AVS-QA, a 300K-example dataset of audio, video, sensor, QA quadruples with synchronized streams, four question types, and frame-level alignment. Table 1 summarizes its scope.

## 3 AVS-QA: Multi-Modal Dataset Curation Pipeline

Despite rapid progress in multi-modal QA, no existing benchmark provides aligned supervision across video, audio, and sensor inputs. Prior QA datasets are either limited to vision-language pairs or omit sensor signals entirely (see Table 1). To bridge this gap, we introduce AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K automatically generated {video, audio, sensor, QA} quadruples. This scale exceeds the combined size of existing egocentric QA datasets by a factor of four. Unlike prior work, AVS-QA includes four question types–open-ended (OE), closed-ended (CE), multiple-choice (MC), and true/false (TF)– supporting both generative and retrieval-style evaluation.

AVS-QA is constructed via a fully automated, three-stage Actor–Evaluator–Critic pipeline, illustrated in Figure 2. The pipeline takes as input a multi-modal triplet $\mathcal { D } = ( v , a , s )$ , where v, a, and s denote temporally aligned video, audio, and sensor streams, and produces question-answer pairs $( q , A ) \in \mathcal { Q }$ . Formally, the dataset generation process is defined as a mapping function $F : \mathcal { D }  \mathcal { Q }$ yielding synchronized $\{ v , a , s , q , A \}$ tuples.

Actor: Multi-modal Prompt Generation. The Actor constructs an enriched scene description from each triplet . We extract visual features using BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023b) (frame captioning) and YOLOv11 (Khanam and Hussain, 2024) (object detection, and localization); audio features using Qwen2-Audio-7B (Chu et al., 2024) (transcription and event labels); and sensor features using a 200 Hz statistical extractor (Imran et al., 2024) over 15-second IMU windows (e.g., mean, RMS, skewness). These cues are concatenated into a natural language prompt, from which the Actor generates four QA types: open-ended, closed-ended, multiple-choice, and true/false. For open-ended questions, five candidate answers are produced for filtering, and one final answer is retained.

Evaluator: Modality-Consistency Filtering. Given a candidate QA pair (q, A) generated from meta-information , the Evaluator verifies that the referenced modality or modalities are supported by the corresponding input triplet $( v , a , s ) \in { \mathcal { D } }$ . For instance, motion-related questions require significant activity in the sensor stream (e.g., variance spike), while visual or auditory references must align with detected objects or acoustic summaries. Pairs lacking sufficient grounding are discarded. To ensure diversity, the Evaluator enforces a balanced mix of single- and cross-modality QA types.

Critic: Quality Ranking via LLM Scoring. For each candidate pair, the Critic applies an ensemble of instruction-tuned LLMs to assess QA quality. Inspired by LLM-as-judge paradigms (Fu et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2023a), we define a quality vector $\mathcal { C } ( q , A ) = [ s _ { 1 } , s _ { 2 } , s _ { 3 } , s _ { 4 } , s _ { 5 } ] \in \mathbb { R } ^ { 5 }$ , where each score corresponds to one of five axes: answerabil-$i t y .$ , hallucination robustness, modality grounding, specificity, and semantic relevance. A QA pair is discarded if any component score falls below a taskspecific threshold (See Appendix B). This stage ensures that all retained examples are interpretable, grounded, and semantically meaningful. The final dataset contains short-form answers across four formats (open-ended, closed-ended, multiple-choice, and true/false), supporting both retrieval and generation in most formats.

Output. AVS-QA is built from egocentric clips in Ego4D (Grauman et al., 2022) and EPIC-Kitchens-100 (Damen et al., 2018), with each example containing synchronized video, audio, sensor data, and a verified answer. The dataset spans 300K QA pairs across three modalities, four QA types, and dual perspectives–offering diverse, fine-grained supervision for multi-modal reasoning. We randomly selected 300 samples from the dataset and conducted a human evaluation following the criteria described in Appendix B.3. Additional statistics and details are provided in Appendix B. For privacy and ethical considerations, see Section 9. The AVS-QA dataset has been publicly released under CC 4.0 license to support reproducibility.

## 4 RAVEN Framework: Query-Token Alignment for Multi-Modal Fusion

RAVEN performs query-conditioned fusion of video, audio, and sensor inputs via token-level alignment. As shown in Figure 3, inputs from each modalities are processed through individual pretrained encoders and projected to a shared space. Our core module, QuART (Query-Aligned Representation of Tokens), computes query-aware relevance scores across all modalities, enabling robust reasoning under noisy or misaligned inputs. We describe each component below and architecture, training, and implementation details available in Appendix C and E.

Modality-Specific Feature Encoders. Given a triplet $\boldsymbol { \mathcal { D } } = \{ v , a , s \}$ , each modality is encoded and projected to $\mathbb { R } ^ { \bar { L } _ { m } \times E }$ Video frames $v =$ $\{ I _ { t } \} _ { t = 1 } ^ { T }$ are sampled uniformly and encoded using SigLIP-so-400m (Zhai et al., 2023), yielding $\mathbf { z } _ { v } = \Phi ^ { v } ( v ) \in \mathbb { R } ^ { L _ { v } \times E }$ . Audio is transformed into a Kaldi-fbank spectrogram (Povey et al., 2011) and encoded via BEATs (Chen et al., 2022) to obtain $\mathbf { z } _ { a } = \Phi ^ { a } ( a ) \in \mathbb { R } ^ { L _ { a } \times E }$ . Sensor data–multi-axis IMU streams–are encoded using LIMU-BERT (Xu et al., 2021), producing $\mathbf { z } _ { s } = \Phi ^ { s } ( s ) \in \mathbb { R } ^ { L _ { s } \times E }$ (See Appendix G for ablation).

Language Decoder and Query Embedding. We use Qwen2-7B-Instruct (Yang et al., 2024) as the decoder-only language model Π. Its tokenizer maps the query $Q$ to token embeddings $\mathbf { z } _ { q } ~ \in ~ \mathbb { R } ^ { L _ { q } \times E }$ Each modality encoder– $- \Phi ^ { v } ( v )$ $\Phi ^ { a } ( a ) , \ \Phi ^ { s } ( s ) { \mathrm { - i } } { \mathrm { s } }$ followed by a projection layer that projects extracted feature into the shared space $\mathbb { R } ^ { L _ { m } \times E }$ . For simplicity, $\Phi ^ { m } ( \cdot )$ refers to the combined encoder and projection for modality $m \in$ $\{ v , a , s \}$ (See Appendix C.3).

Figure 3: Overview of RAVEN. Each modality (video, audio, sensor) is encoded using pretrained encoders and projected into a shared space. The QuART module performs query-conditioned token relevance scoring to align informative tokens across modalities. The figure also highlights the three-stage training pipeline for alignment-aware multi-modal reasoning. Here, and represent trainable and frozen components, respectively.

QuART: Query-Aligned Representation of Tokens. The QuART module performs queryconditioned token selection over multi-modal inputs. Given visual, audio, and sensor token sequences $\mathbf { z } _ { v } , \mathbf { z } _ { a } , \mathbf { z } _ { s } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { L _ { m } \times E }$ , we concatenate them into a unified token matrix $\mathbf { Z } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { L \times E }$ , where ${ \cal L } = { \cal L } _ { v } + { \cal L } _ { a } + { \cal L } _ { s }$ . We apply multi-head attention between the query embedding $\mathbf { z } _ { q }$ and Z as: $\mathbf { Q } = \mathbf { z } _ { q } \mathbf { W } ^ { Q } , \mathbf { K } = \mathbf { Z } \mathbf { W } ^ { K } , \mathbf { V } = \mathbf { Z } \mathbf { W } ^ { V }$ where $\mathbf { W } ^ { Q } , \mathbf { W } ^ { K } , \mathbf { W } ^ { V } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { E \times d _ { k } }$ are learned projections. Temporal order is preserved via sinusoidal positional embeddings, as in standard Transformer encoders. The aggregated attention output is M = softmax $\begin{array} { r } { \left( \frac { \mathbf { Q } \mathbf { K } ^ { \top } } { \sqrt { d _ { k } } } \right) \mathbf { V } } \end{array}$

Unlike standard multi-head attention–which uses similarity-based weights across modalities– QuART introduces a relevance projection head, $\mathbf { W } ^ { R } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { E \times L }$ , that learns to score tokens conditioned on the query. This separation enables the model to prioritize semantically relevant tokens even when distractors receive high attention weights–a key advantage under modality mismatch. QuART uses learned relevance scores to prioritize tokens based on the question. For instance, when asked about gentle placement, it emphasizes sensor deceleration and impact sounds while downweighting static visual frames. If the camera is occluded and the user trips, only IMU spikes and audio thuds are informative–QuART gates out blank video. This behavior generalizes, suppressing offscreen audio when questions target visual actions. This token-level relevance scores are computed as: $\pmb { \alpha } = \mathsf { s o f t m a x } ( \mathbf { M } \mathbf { W } ^ { R } )$ . The fused context vector, $\begin{array} { r } { \mathbf { C } = \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { L } \alpha _ { j } \mathbf { Z } _ { j } } \end{array}$ aggregates query-weighted tokens across all modalities and conditions the LLM decoder. This learned relevance outperforms raw attention (Section 6.2).

Training Objective. The decoder Π predicts the output sequence $\{ y _ { t } \} _ { t = 1 } ^ { T }$ conditioned on C, trained via autoregressive cross-entropy: $\begin{array} { r l } { \mathcal { L } _ { \mathbf { Q u A R T } } } & { { } = } \end{array}$ $\begin{array} { r l } { - \frac { 1 } { T } \sum _ { t = 1 } ^ { T } \log p _ { \theta } ( y _ { t } } & { { } | \quad y _ { < t } , \mathbf { C } ) } \end{array}$ To promote sparse selection of relevant tokens, we introduce an entropy-based regularizer: $\begin{array} { r l } { \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e g } } } & { { } = } \end{array}$ $\textstyle \sum _ { j = 1 } ^ { L } \alpha _ { j }$ log $\alpha _ { j }$ .The total loss is

$$
\mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { R A V E N } } = \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { Q u A R T } } + \lambda \mathcal { L } _ { \mathrm { r e g } }\tag{1}
$$

We encourage sparsity via entropy regularization scaled by λ. Relevance is disabled in early stages $( { \bf C } = { \bf Z } , \lambda = 0 )$ and enabled in the final stage with λ = 0.001. See Appendix E for implementation & hyperparameters and Appendix H for cost analysis. Table 7 and Appendix G demonstrate QuART’s advantage over SOTA alignment methods.

## 5 Alignment-Aware Multi-Stage Training for Multi-Modal Reasoning

We adopt a three-stage training procedure to optimize RAVEN and its query-conditioned alignment module. Each stage targets a distinct component– projection alignment, query-token fusion, and robustness to input degradation–stabilizing learning and reducing cross-modal interference (Figure 3). Stage I: Modality-Text Pre-Training. In this pretraining stage, we use a large-scale, weakly labeled dataset of modality-text pairs: {video, text}, {image, text}, {audio, text}, and {sensor, text}, collected from caption-rich sources, e.g., WavCaps (Mei et al., 2024), and InternVid-10M (Wang et al., 2023). We adopt a sequential, modality-specific training strategy to avoid inter-modal interference and stabilize projection learning. Supervision is provided via natural language captions or transcriptions paired with raw modality inputs, such as video subtitles, audio narrations, and wearable sensor logs. For each modality $m \in \{ v , a , s \}$ , we freeze the pretrained encoder $\Phi ^ { m } ( \cdot )$ and language model Π, and update only the corresponding projection head $P ^ { m }$ to align with textual supervision. All three branches are trained in succession using the same LLM decoder, promoting consistent language grounding across modalities.

Stage II: Query-Token Alignment Joint-Training. After modality-specific alignment, we train the QuART module to perform token-level fusion conditioned on natural language queries. We use the AVS-QA dataset for this stage, which provides synchronized video, audio, sensor, and query-answer supervision (Equation 1). All modality encoders Φ<sup>v</sup>, Φ<sup>a</sup>, Φ<sup>s</sup> and their projection heads are frozen to preserve previously learned alignments. We initialize QuART from scratch and train it to compute relevance-weighted token representations that bridge cross-modal information and the query context. In parallel, we fine-tune the LLM decoder Π using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022) with rank 256, offering efficient adaptation to fused multi-modal inputs without catastrophic forgetting. This stage enables query-aware modality fusion, teaching RAVEN to prioritize informative tokens for reasoning and generation.

Stage III: Modal-Discrepancy Aware Finetuning. To improve robustness under real-world conditions, we fine-tune RAVEN using perturbed multi-modal inputs that simulate modality mismatch–such as dropped sensor packets or offscreen audio. We apply stochastic transformations independently to each modality: video undergoes frame jitter, dropout, or temporal inversion; audio is corrupted with Gaussian noise, reversed, or replaced with unrelated samples; sensor signals are perturbed with zero-centered Gaussian noise based on empirical variance (see Appendix D). Perturbed inputs $\tilde { \mathcal { D } } = \{ \tilde { v } , \tilde { a } , \tilde { s } \}$ are encoded by frozen encoders $\Phi ^ { m }$ and passed through the trained QuART module and LoRA-adapted decoder Π. During this stage, we activate entropy regularization to sharpen token relevance and encourage sparse, discriminative alignment. We set $\lambda = 0 . 0 0 1$ in the final stage, as it yields the best trade-off between sparsity and accuracy (see Section 6.2); earlier stages use $\lambda = 0$ . See Appendix E for full training details.

## 6 Experimental Evaluation of RAVEN

Training Datasets. RAVEN is pretrained (Stage I) on 13.1M weakly aligned modality–text pairs (e.g., InternVid-10M, WavCaps, SensorCaps), and finetuned (Stages II–III) on 510K high-quality QA pairs from AVS-QA. See Appendix E.1 for details. Validation Datasets. We evaluate on seven audiovisual QA benchmarks spanning exocentric and egocentric domains: AVSD (Alamri et al., 2019), MUSIC-QA (Li et al., 2022), AVSSD (Chen et al., 2020), MSVD-QA (Alamri et al., 2019), MSRVTT-QA (Xu et al., 2016), ActivityNet-QA (Yu et al., 2019), and EgoThink (Cheng et al., 2024a), plus the 58K held-out test set from AVS-QA (Appendix F.2). Evaluation metrics (GPT based) follow prior work (Maaz et al., 2023) as detailed in Appendix F.3.

Baseline Models. We compare against SOTA models across both domains. For egocentric QA: Valley (Luo et al., 2023), VideoChat (Li et al., 2023c), VTimeLLM (Huang et al., 2024), PandaGPT (Su et al., 2023), MacawLLM (Lyu et al., 2023), AV-LLM (Shu et al., 2023), Video-LLaMA (Zhang et al., 2023a), AVicuna (Tang et al., 2024), and Video-LLaMA2 (Cheng et al., 2024b); for exocentric QA: OpenFlamingo (Awadalla et al., 2023), BLIP-2.6 (Li et al., 2023b), VideoChat-7B (Li et al., 2023c), LLaVA-1.5 (Liu et al., 2024a), MiniGPT4 (Zhu et al., 2023b), InstructBLIP (Liu et al., 2023b), LLaMA-Adapter (Zhang et al., 2023b), VideoLLaVA (Lin et al., 2023a), and ShareGPT4V (Chen et al., 2024a). All baselines use official checkpoints (See Appendix F.1).

Exocentric Audio-Visual. Table 2 shows that RAVEN outperforms SOTA models on video QA (by up to 8.0%) and AVQA (by 5.0%), surpassing QA-specific fusion models (e.g., AV-LLM, Macaw–LLM). These gains stem from QuART’s fine-grained, query-conditioned relevance scores, which enhance alignment and suppress irrelevant inputs. Performance is competitive but not superior on curated benchmarks like AVSSD, where modality-based relevance scoring may be less impactful due to limited cross-modal variability.

Egocentric Audio-Visual Results. Table 3 reports results on EgoThink and AVS-QA. RAVEN achieves the highest overall performance–53.5 average on EgoThink (+14.6%) and 0.67 on AVS-QA (+7.5%)–with strong gains in Completeness (0.71, +9.8%) and Correctness (0.69, +8.7%). While baselines like OpenFlamingo-7B and BLIP-2.6-7B perform moderately (e.g., 21.0 on Count, 0.31 on Completeness), and VideoLLaVA-7B excels in specific categories (e.g., 66.0 in Situated), RAVEN delivers the best overall scores.

Sensor-Aware Evaluation on AVS-QA. Table 4 reports results on AVS-QA across modalities (V/A/S) and metrics (Completeness, Coherence, Accuracy, Avg). RAVEN performs better than baselines like VideoLLaMA2 with A+V fusion (+21.8% avg). However, RAVEN with A+V+S achieves an additional performance gain of 16.4% – highlighting the benefit of sensor modality and sensor-aware reasoning. These results validate the importance of query-guided sensor integration for context-rich QA.

Cross-modal mismatch. Table 5 shows RAVEN effectively handles cross-modal mismatch. Trained with Stages I and II, it outperforms prior SOTA on AVQA by 30–79%. On AVS-QA, Stage III finetuning boosts performance to 0.71–0.79, surpassing Video-LLaMA2 (0.51–0.54). These gains stem from QuART ’s query-to-token alignment, which emphasizes semantically relevant tokens even under modality misalignment.

## 6.2 Ablation Study

Training Stages and Loss Conditioning. We ablate training stages, loss formulation, and regularization strength across six QA benchmarks (Table 6). Conditioning ${ \mathcal { L } } _ { \mathbf { Q u A R T } }$ on contextual embeddings C (vs. raw Z) in Stage II improves performance (e.g., AVS-QA Avg: 0.49 vs. 0.44), confirming the value of context in alignment. Adding regularization in Stage III boosts robustness but is sensitive to λ: a high value (1.0) hurts performance (AVS-QA Avg: 0.30), while λ = 0.001 yields the best results–raising AVS-QA Avg to 0.78 (+43%), Coherence to 0.82 (+15.9%), and Accuracy to 0.73 (+16.4%). Similar gains appear on ActivityNet-QA (+18.4%) and MUSIC-QA (+24.5%). Overall, best performance is achieved with Stage III, contextaware ${ \mathcal { L } } _ { \mathbf { Q u A R T } }$ , and λ = 0.001–highlighting the synergy between structured alignment and calibrated regularization.

Effect of Learnable Relevance Projection $( \mathbf { W } ^ { R } )$ Table 7 compares QuART ’s learnable projection head $\mathbf { W } ^ { R }$ against raw attention and two state-ofthe-art token relevance methods: Q-Former (Li et al., 2023b) and HierarQ (Azad et al., 2025). QuART achieves the highest accuracy across all benchmarks while using fewer parameters (45M vs. 188M/390M). By transforming attention scores into query-conditioned relevance weights, $\mathbf { W } ^ { R }$ enables efficient and interpretable cross-modal alignment. Additional ablations – including encoder choices, LoRA rank, token selection – are provided in Appendix G, along with qualitative examples in Appendix I.

## 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we present RAVEN, a unified framework for multimodal question answering that integrates video, audio, and sensor inputs via query-aware alignment, enabling robust reasoning under modality disagreement. To support this, we release AVS-QA–the first large-scale dataset of synchronized {Audio, Video, Sensor,

QA} quadruples–curated via an automated actorevaluator-critic pipeline. Spanning egocentric settings and four QA types, AVS-QA enables comprehensive benchmarking. Our three-stage training– modality pretraining, query-conditioned alignment, and perturbation-aware fine-tuning–drives consistent gains across diverse multimodal QA benchmarks. These results underscore the importance of structured, query-aware reasoning in handling real-world modality mismatch.

## 8 Limitations

While RAVEN provides a strong foundation for multimodal question answering over audio, video, and sensor inputs, our current experiments are limited to a single backbone model, Qwen-Instruct-7B, due to computational constraints. We do not explore larger LLM variants (e.g., 13B or 70B), which could further improve performance but require significantly more resources. Additionally, we leave the investigation of alternative language backbones and more advanced fusion strategies (e.g., retrieval-augmented alignment, memory-based conditioning) as future work.

We also note that for longer recordings (exceeding 5 minutes), particularly those involving visually dense scenes, RAVEN occasionally underperforms on vision-heavy queries. This is likely caused by our uniform frame selection strategy, which may miss critical visual cues in longer videos because of sparse temporal sampling. Incorporating adaptive or query-guided frame selection could mitigate this issue and improve temporal grounding.

Finally, training RAVEN is computationally expensive. Our current setup required approximately 120 hours on 4 NVIDIA A100 GPUs (each with 80 GB of memory). While the design is efficient at inference time due to early token filtering, future work could further reduce training cost through distillation or parameter sharing across modalities. Future Directions. Future work on RAVEN includes exploring joint training strategies across modalities to enable deeper cross-modal interactions and more robust representation learning. Incorporating a saliency-aware frame selection mechanism may further improve performance on longform, visually complex inputs. Additionally, reducing or eliminating the need to fine-tune the LLM backbone when introducing new modalities remains an open challenge. Addressing this could significantly improve the scalability, adaptability, and deployment efficiency of multimodal language models.

## 9 Ethical Considerations

The AVS-QA dataset is derived entirely from publicly released egocentric datasets (Ego4D (Grauman et al., 2022) and EPIC-Kitchens (Damen et al., 2018)) that include usage licenses permitting research redistribution. Our processing pipeline does not introduce new identity annotations, and we do not extract or distribute personally identifiable metadata. AVS-QA contains synthetic question–answer pairs generated from visual, auditory, and sensor summaries, and no raw video, audio, or IMU recordings are included in the release. We follow best practices for anonymization and respect the original datasets’ ethical use guidelines.

## 10 Risk Statement

Our multimodal language model integrates audio, visual, and sensor inputs to enhance reasoning, but it raises several concerns. First, misuse of MLLMs in surveillance, biometric inference, or manipulation of multi-sensory content raises ethical concerns regarding user privacy and consent, especially when applied to egocentric or sensor-rich environments. Additionally, the interpretability of cross-modal reasoning remains limited, making it difficult to identify failure cases or mitigate hallucinations across modalities. We recommend careful deployment of such systems with human oversight, ongoing auditing of training data sources, and future work on explainability and robust alignment to reduce these risks.

## B AVS-QA Dataset Details

## B.1 Curation and Statistical Summary

Dataset Curation Stages. In the Actor phase, we generated 387K question–answer pairs. The Evaluator filtered out 12.14% based on predefined constraints. In the Critic phase, an additional 40K QA pairs were discarded based on aggregate scores from multiple critics. This results in a final dataset of 300K high-quality QA pairs used for training and evaluation.

Distribution of Question Types. AVS-QA includes four primary question types to support diverse reasoning tasks: open-ended, close-ended, true/false, and multiple choice. Figure 4 shows the distribution of these four categories. “Others” category include instructional or dialoguestyle prompts that do not fit traditional QA formats. This variety enables comprehensive benchmarking across free-form generation and structured prediction settings.

Length Distribution of Questions and Answers. We analyze the word-length distributions of questions and answers in AVS-QA to better understand their linguistic diversity. As shown in Figure 5, most questions are concise, with a mode around 9– 10 words and a long-tail distribution extending up to 40 words. This variation arises from the presence of both short, structured formats (e.g., true/false, multiple choice) and more descriptive open-ended queries.

![](images/09b8129c40b6dad97009669f593083f803fe3da955c1f05b807e079c4d42eb53.jpg)  
Figure 4: Distribution of question types in AVS-QA. The dataset includes a diverse mix of open-ended, closeended, true/false, multiple choice, and other formats, supporting comprehensive evaluation settings.

Figure 5: Length of questions has some variation due to different types of questions.

Figure 6 shows that a large number of answers consist of a single word, primarily due to true/false and multiple choice formats. In contrast, closeended and open-ended questions yield longer and more varied responses, contributing to a broad distribution that peaks between 3–10 words and extends beyond 25 words. These distributions highlight the reasoning and generation challenges posed by AVS-QA.

## B.2 Quality Ranking via LLM Scoring

To evaluate the quality of multi-modal (audio, video, sensor) question-answer pairs, we design a set of five quality assessment axes. Each axis is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = poor, 5 = excellent) by large language models (LLMs) using structured prompts:

Answerability. Evaluates whether the question is answerable based on the provided multi-modal context. A high score indicates that the combined modalities contain sufficient and coherent information to support a correct and complete answer.

Hallucination Robustness. Measures the extent to which the answer avoids introducing information not grounded in the provided modalities. Higher scores indicate reliable adherence to the multimodal context, while lower scores reflect a greater risk of hallucination.

Cross-Modal Grounding. Assesses the degree to which the answer integrates information across modalities (e.g., referencing audio to explain visual content). Higher scores reflect strong cross-modal coherence and accurate alignment with modalityspecific cues relevant to the question.

Specificity. Measures the level of detail and precision in the answer relative to the question. Higher scores indicate clear, specific, and well-defined responses that avoid vague or generic statements, offering informative and actionable insights.

Relevance. Measures how directly the answer addresses the intent and scope of the question. Higher scores indicate focused, contextually appropriate responses that are clearly aligned with the queried scenario and available modalities.

Each QA pair is scored across the five axes by LLaVA-1.5(Liu et al., 2024a), Gemeni Pro (Team et al., 2023), Qwen-VL (Bai et al., 2023), GPT-4o (Achiam et al., 2023), LLaMA-3 (Grattafiori et al., 2024) in a zero-shot setting. We compute the final quality score by averaging the axis-level ratings. We discard QA pairs where 2 axes receive a score <3 from at least 3 of 5 LLMs. This threshold was chosen based on alignment with human judgment (see Appendix B.3).

## B.3 Human Evaluation

We conducted a human evaluation on a randomly selected subset of 300 question-answer pairs from AVS-QA. Two expert annotators independently reviewed each sample and assigned quality ratings based on the accompanying video, audio, and sensor data. Ratings follow the same 5-point Likert format as the LLM scorer.

We categorized the pairs based on human agreement: Satisfied (both annotators rate 4), Okay (mixed rating: one 4, one <4), and Not Satisfied (both <4). We observe 81% Satisfied, 7% Okay, and 12% Not Satisfied.

This aligns closely with the filtering performed by our LLM critic, which rejected 40K of the initial 340K QA pairs (11.76%), indicating strong agreement between human and automatic judgments. This suggests that our LLMbased scoring framework is a reliable proxy for human evaluation at scale.

We recruited two annotators through internal advertisements at the host institution. Both male annotators were between 25–35 years old and had a basic understanding of large language models. Participation was voluntary, and no financial incentives were provided.

## B.4 Prompt for Dataset Curation

We use a structured Actor–Evaluator–Critic pipeline for automatic generation and refinement of question–answer pairs. Figures 7–12 show the system and user prompts used at each stage of this pipeline.

In the Actor phase, a language model is provided with multimodal scene descriptions—including audio, video, IMU data summaries, and human narration—and is prompted to generate diverse questions spanning open-ended, close-ended, multiple choice, and true/false formats. The prompt encourages context-aware and modality-specific reasoning (see Figures 7–8).

I will provide you with 5 different pieces of information from   
different modalities (visual, audio, IMU) about a scene where   
someone performs some type of activity. The information   
contains:   
1. A narration for the entire scene   
2. Objects present in the scene, and their normalized bounding   
box as a list of tuples.   
3. A summary of the scene from the audio describing the scene   
only hearing the audio.   
4. Statistical features from the IMU data for the accelerometer   
and gyroscope in the x, y, and z-axis.   
5. A human describing the activity.   
I want you to be a smart agent, imagine yourself present in the   
scene, and consider all the modalities to understand the entire   
scene. Now you have to generate question-answer pairs of   
different types (e.g., open-ended, close-ended, multiple choice,   
True-False, etc.). The question-answers should require multi  
step and complex reasoning to answer. Use one or multiple   
modality information to generate the questions and answers.   
Ensure that the knowledge and reasoning chains in the question   
are precise and sufficiently challenging, to the extent that   
only experts in the respective field can provide adequate   
responses.   
Here are some examples of different question-answer types:   
What is the person likely doing in the scene?   
Answer: The person is likely eating at the table, as there is a   
plate of <food\_name>, and a <some\_utencils>present.   
The person is actively cutting <object\_name\_1>, and a   
<object\_name\_2> is present. True or False?   
Answer: Cutting <object\_name\_1> True, but <object\_name\_2> is not   
present.

## Figure 7: System prompt used for generating questions and answers in Actor phase.

Please generate two question answers of each type of open-ended,   
close-ended, multiple choice and True-False. Generate five   
answers for each open-ended question and single answer for other   
type of questions. Give the output in a list of JSON format   
e.g., [{{“question”: ”Generated Question”, “answer\_1”:   
“Generated Answer 1”, “answer\_2”: “Generated Answer 2”,   
“question\_type”: “question\_type”}}, ….]. The “question\_type”   
would be of one of these four types (open-ended, close-ended,   
multiple choice, True-False).   
Entire Scene Narration: {}   
Objects Present: {}   
Audio Description: {}   
IMU features: {}   
Human description: {}  
Figure 8: User prompt used for generating questions and answers in Actor phase.

In the Evaluator phase, a second model verifies the answerability, modality grounding, and factual correctness of each QA pair. The system prompt (Figure 9) outlines constraints regarding modality coverage, object grounding, and language consistency. The human prompt (Figure 10) ensures no hallucinated corrections are introduced—only local improvements to existing QA pairs.

In the Critic phase, large language models are prompted to rate the quality of each generated question–answer pair using four dimensions: relevance, correctness, clarity, and depth. As shown in Figures 11–12, the system prompt instructs the model to consider all five available modalityspecific inputs (narration, object list, audio summary, IMU features, and human description) before assigning a score.

I will provide you multiple questions and corresponding answers   
which were generated using 5 different pieces of information   
from different modalities (visual, audio, IMU) about a scene   
where someone performs some type of activity. The information   
contains   
1. A narration for the entire scene   
2. Objects present in the scene, and their normalized bounding   
box as a list of tuples.   
3. A summary of the scene from the audio describing the scene   
only hearing the audio.   
4. Statistical features from the IMU data for the accelerometer   
and gyroscope in the x, y, and z-axis.   
5. A human describing the activity.   
I will also provide you the five different information that were   
used.   
I want you to be a smart evaluator who can analyze the quality   
of generated questions and answer using the provided information   
from all modalities.   
You have to make sure that the following constrains have been   
followed strictly.   
The question-answer pairs must meet the following constraints:   
1. MUST exclude terms like “according to the narration”,   
“according to the audio description,”, "Human narration", "based   
on scene description", "audio description", etc from both   
Questions and Answers. You should generate questions and answer   
them as if you are present in the scene and reason from one or   
more modalities.   
2. Question-answer pairs should be as diverse as possible.   
3. Only ask the questions that can be answered. If a question   
can not be answered from one modality try other modalities to   
answer that. For example, if something is not visible (obscure   
in visual modality) use audio or IMU to find the answer.   
4. The answers should be less than 30 words.   
5. When generating questions about any object, first make sure   
that the object is present in the "objects present" list or   
match with the entire scene narration.   
6. Use both human description and entire scene narration when   
describing the scene. if there is inconsistency between these   
two, prioritize human description.   
if the constraints are not met for any given question answer   
pair, update them accordingly and save them in a similar form in   
a json file. DO NOT CHANGE QUESTIONS ENTIRELY, ONLY IMPROVE   
THEM. Additionally, do not add any co-ordinates.  
Figure 9: System prompt used for generating questions and answers in Evaluator phase. The constraints ensure avoiding some phrases or groups of words to enhance the quality of question-answer pairs.

Please determine if the question-answer pair strictly follow the   
constraints based on the following five information:   
Entire Scene Narration: {}   
Objects Present: {}   
Audio Description: {}   
IMU features: {}   
Human description: {}   
Only output the updated question and answers.   
DO NOT MENTION ANY KEY IMPROVEMENTS IN THE OUTPUT OR ANY OTHER   
TEXT EXCEPT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.  
Figure 10: User prompt used for generating questions and answers in Evaluator phase.

The user prompt standardizes the response format and explicitly prohibits speculative reasoning or textual justification—ensuring consistent, numerical evaluations across samples. Each QA pair receives two scores (one for the question, one for the answer), which are then aggregated across multiple critics to determine inclusion in the final dataset. QA pairs with low aggregate scores are discarded during the final curation step.

This prompt engineering strategy supports diverse and high-quality QA generation without human-in-the-loop authoring.

## C Additional Model Architecture Details

## C.1 LIMU-BERT Pre-Training

As our sensor encoder, we employ LIMU-BERT (Xu et al., 2021), a multi-head attentionbased encoder-decoder architecture. LIMU-BERT is a lightweight, BERT-inspired self-supervised representation learning model designed for mobile IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensing applications. It processes unlabeled IMU data—accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings—to learn generalizable features. The architecture incorporates a normalization and sensor fusion layer, followed by a transformer encoder with cross-layer parameter sharing to reduce model size. It adopts a span-masking version of the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task to learn both distributional and temporal patterns from the IMU sequences. We adopt the official LIMU-BERT implementation under the MIT license for research use.

## C.2 Unimodal Encoder Pre-Training

We use the VideoLLaMA2 (Cheng et al., 2024b) codebase for pre-training the vision encoder. The encoder is initialized from a SigLIP checkpoint and fine-tuned with instructional video datasets included in the VideoLLaMA2 training suite. This setup enables the model to learn temporal and spatial reasoning over egocentric and exocentric scenes. The code is released under the Apache 2.0 license and used strictly for research purposes.

## C.3 Projection Layer

Each modality-specific encoder output is projected to the LLM input dimension using a tailored strategy. The output of the audio encoder is projected through a two-layer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to align with the LLM dimension. For the video encoder output, we use a spatio-temporal convolutional (STC) connector for spatio-temporal learning of the video. STC connector uses RegStage (Radosavovic et al., 2020) with 3D convolution for downsampling the video output. We use a publicly available adaptation of the STC-connector in our implementation (Cheng et al., 2024b) under the license of Apache 2.0 for research purposes only.

## D Cross-Modal Mismatch Generation and Robustness Evaluation

Cross-modal mismatch refers to the condition in which the semantic alignment between different input modalities—such as audio, video, and sensor streams—is disrupted. In real-world multi-modal systems, such mismatches frequently arise due to noise, missing data, or temporal desynchronization between modalities. Understanding and addressing cross-modal mismatch is crucial for building robust models capable of effective reasoning across modalities.

To systematically evaluate model robustness under such conditions, we introduce a synthetic crossmodal mismatch generation process. Given a clean multi-modal datapoint $D = \{ a , v , s \}$ , where a, v, and s denote the synchronized audio, video, and sensor streams respectively, we construct a perturbed version $D ^ { \prime } = \{ a ^ { \prime } , v ^ { \prime } , s ^ { \prime } \}$ by applying one or more of the following perturbations:

Modality-Specific Noise Injection.: Gaussian or environmental noise is added to the audio a and/or video v streams, degrading signal fidelity while preserving temporal structure.

Temporal Reversal.: The temporal sequence of audio or video is reversed independently, altering the causal and sequential semantics of events.

Algorithm 1 Algorithm for generating Cross-Modal Mismatch   
1: function GENERATECROSSMODALMISMATCH(D = a, v, s )   
2: Initialize $D ^ { \prime } = \{ a ^ { \prime } , v ^ { \prime } , s ^ { \prime } \}  \{ a , v , s \}$   
3: Define $P _ { \mathrm { a u d i o } }  \{ \mathrm { A D D N O I S E }$ , REVERSE, REPLACEWITHIRRELEVANT, NOPERTURBATION   
4: Define P<sub>video</sub> ADDNOISE, REVERSE, REPLACEWITHIRRELEVANT, NOPERTURBATION   
5: Define $P _ { \mathrm { s e n s o r } }  \{ \mathrm { A }$ DDJITTER, REPLACEWITHIRRELEVANT, NOPERTURBATION   
6: if RandomChoice([True, False]) then   
7: $a ^ { \prime } \gets$ RandomChoice $( P _ { \mathrm { a u d i o } } ) ( a )$   
8: else   
9: $a ^ { \prime } \gets a$   
10: end if   
11: if RandomChoice([True, False]) then   
12: v′ RandomChoice $P _ { \mathrm { v i d e o } } ) ( v )$   
13: else   
14: $v ^ { \prime }  v$   
15: end if   
16: if RandomChoice([True, False]) then   
17: s′ RandomChoice $ { \mathcal { P } } _ { \mathrm { s e n s o r } } ) ( s )$   
18: else   
19: $s ^ { \prime }  s$   
20: end if   
21: return $D ^ { \prime } = \{ a ^ { \prime } , v ^ { \prime } , s ^ { \prime } \}$   
22: end function

Sensor Perturbation.: Random noise or jitter is added to sensor streams (e.g., IMU data), simulating faulty or low-resolution sensor readings.

Modal Replacement.: One or more modalities (e.g., audio) are replaced with semantically irrelevant counterparts sampled from other unrelated datapoints in the dataset, creating intentional crossmodal conflict.

These perturbations simulate realistic mismatches commonly encountered in egocentric and exocentric environments, such as microphone occlusion, corrupted video frames, or misaligned sensor logging. This synthetic mismatch generation enables controlled stress testing of multi-modal models, revealing their capacity to handle noisy, misaligned, or contradictory inputs across modalities. Algorithm 1 explains the process used for generating cross-modal mismatch.

## E Training and Implementation Details

## E.1 Dataset for Multistage Training

Along with our in-house data (AVS-QA), we use publicly available datasets to train the video, audio, and sensor encoders. To pre-train the sensor encoder, we use epic kitchen (Damen et al., 2018), ego4D (Grauman et al., 2022),HHAR (Stisen et al., 2015), UCI-HAR (Reyes-Ortiz et al., 2016), Shoaib (Shoaib et al., 2014), Motion-Sense (Malekzadeh et al., 2019), PAMAP2 (Roggen et al., 2010) data. We use pre-trained SigLIP as our video encoder and then fine-tune it with datasets from videoLLama2 (Cheng et al., 2024b). Similarly, we use a pre-trained audio encoder, Beats, and fine-tune it with WavCaps (Mei et al., 2024) datasets (Chen et al., 2022). We leverage SensoCaps and OpenSQA (Imran et al., 2024) for the sensor pretraining part. Table 8 summarizes the dataset used at different stages of training.

## E.2 Hyperparameters for Training

RAVEN has 8.5B parameters, including all the encoders, projection layers, QuART, and LLM backbone. Table 9 summarizes the key hyperparameters used during training.

## E.3 Train-Test split

For all publicly available datasets used during pretraining and fine-tuning, we adopt the official train– test splits provided by their respective authors. For our curated dataset, AVS-QA, we create a standardized train–test split to ensure consistent evaluation and reproducibility. To prevent data leakage and overfitting, we ensure the input sessions for curating AVS-QA train and test split remain completely separated. The split files are publicly available in our GitHub repository https://github.com/ BASHLab/RAVEN/tree/main/avs-qa-dataset.

Effect of Modality Encoder. We investigate the influence of visual and audio encoder choices on model performance across three video QA benchmarks (Tables 10, 11). For vision, scaling standard ViT architectures from B/16 to H/14 yields only marginal improvements (e.g., +1.8% on MSVD-

QA), suggesting limited benefits from increasing model capacity alone. In contrast, substituting ViT with SigLip, a vision-language pretrained model leads to substantial performance gains (73.3 vs. 67.5 on MSVD-QA), demonstrating the importance of cross-modal alignment during pretraining. On the audio side, scaling Whisper encoders from Tiny to Small results in modest improvements (e.g., +1.6% on MSVD-QA), but all Whisper variants are outperformed by BEATs, a model pretrained on diverse acoustic signals. Notably, BEATs achieves a +5.2% gain over Whisper-Small on MSVD-QA, highlighting the efficacy of domain-specific audio pertaining.

LoRA Rank Selection. Figure 14 shows an ablation on LoRA rank. Lower ranks improve efficiency but may limit representational capacity, while higher ranks offer greater adaptability at a higher cost. Performance peaks at r = 256, indicating it provides the best trade-off between computational overhead and task effectiveness.

Table 13: Comparison of QuART with General Fusion Approaches. QuART performs better due to its token level reasoning capabilities.

Comparison of QuART with General Fusion Approaches. We compare QuART with stateof-the-art general-purpose fusion models (Image-Bind (Girdhar et al., 2023), MBT (Nagrani et al., 2021), and AVFIC (Nagrani et al., 2022)), which are not optimized for QA tasks. As shown in Table 13, QuART outperforms these models, highlighting the benefit of QA-specific supervision and token-level fusion for effective reasoning.

Effect of Frame Selection Strategy. We adopted a uniform frame sampling strategy, consistent with prior video QA and egocentric video research (Cheng et al., 2024b; Tang et al., 2024), to ensure fair comparison and reproducibility.

However, we evaluated RAVEN leveraging several alternative frame selection methods, including fixed stride, random, and oracle-based selection. Notably, performance (Table 12) remained mostly consistent across all methods, except for random sampling, which caused increased variability and occasional performance drops. For oraclebased selection, we used salient frame annotations and metadata from EpicKitchen-100 and Ego4D to choose visually informative frames. While this led to small improvements in some vision-intensive queries, the overall trends of RAVEN ’s performance remained unchanged. These findings suggest that QuART is resilient to the choice of frame selection, although future work could investigate learned or adaptive methods to further enhance performance on long video reasoning.

## H Compute Cost and Environmental Impact

We train our model using four NVIDIA A100 GPUs (80GB each) with a total CPU memory of 256GB. Evaluation is performed on four NVIDIA L40S GPUs (46GB each). Training runs for 120 hours with a local batch size of 1 and a global batch size of 4. We use a learning rate of $1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ for the projection layers and $1 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ for fine-tuning the encoder layers.

We estimate the total energy consumption to be approximately 1,200 kWh, based on the average power draw of an A100 system under mixed precision load. Following the ML $\mathrm { { C O } _ { 2 } }$ emissions calculator (Lacoste et al., 2019), this corresponds to an estimated carbon footprint of 420 kgCO<sub>2</sub>e when using the U.S. average energy mix.

## Audio+Video

A pot on the stove with a spoon or spatula inside, indicating food preparation. However, without motion cues, it’s uncertain if the user is actively stirring or simply placed the utensil there earlier. There’s no indication of speaking or precise  movement.

## Audio+Video+ Sensor

We observe a cooking setup with a spatula in the pot. Audio suggests no sound of stirring. IMU data confirms no hand or body movement, consistent with no  stirring or shifting stance. Together, these cues verify that the user is not actively cooking, moving, and speaking during the activity.

Figure 15: Example illustrating the value of sensor input for activity disambiguation. Given the question “Was the user actively cooking or stirring something in the pot on the stove?”, the Audio+Video model observes a cooking scene but cannot confirm active engagement due to the absence of motion cues. In contrast, the Audio+Video+Sensor model leverages IMU data to detect a lack of body movement and integrates audio signals to confirm no stirring, allowing it to infer that the user is not actively cooking

## What activity is the person likely engaged in?

## Audio+Video

The person is likely washing dishes especially lathering a ladle in the kitchen sink. The sound of water running and dishes being washed with the presence of sink and bowl, and hand likely explain the activity.

## Audio+Video+ Sensor

The person is lathering a ladle with hands in the kitchen sink. The IMU data confirms very small variance due to the person's less movement. Water running sound and low IMU movement suggest small washing activity.

Figure 16: Example illustrating subtle activity disambiguation using multimodal reasoning. Given the question “What activity is the person likely engaged in?”, the Audio+Video model identifies dishwashing activity based on sink visibility and audio cues such as water flow. The Audio+Video+Sensor model enhances this understanding by incorporating IMU data, which reveals low hand and body movement. This confirms a controlled, repetitive action consistent with small-scale washing (e.g., lathering a ladle), demonstrating the added value of sensor input for refining temporal and motion-level interpretations.

## I Qualitative Results

Figures 15 – 19 illustrate the performance of RAVEN across diverse real-world scenarios. While RAVEN demonstrates strong performance using only audio and visual inputs, the inclusion of sensor data consistently improves robustness and interpretability.

In particular, 17 and 18 highlight how sensor information enhances the correctness and relevance of both the predicted answer and its supporting explanation. Conversely, Figure 19 presents a failure case where the model, even with full audio-videosensor input, fails to infer the correct task due to subtle contextual clues across modalities that might not clearly differentiate similar tasks, hindering accurate inference.

## Audio+Video

The person is not likely doing any other activities other than washing hands. The presence of hand and water sound confirm washing hands. No other information is available to suggest other activities.

## Audio+Video+ Sensor

The person is reaching for soap besides washing hands. While presence of hands and water running sound establish washing hands activities, sudden changes in IMU data suggest movement of the arm to reach for the soap.

Figure 17: Example demonstrating the added value of sensor data in identifying subtle concurrent actions. Given the question “Is the person engaged in any other activities other than washing hands?”, the Audio+Video model detects only hand presence and water sounds, concluding that no other activities are evident. In contrast, the Audio+Video+Sensor model identifies a sudden IMU spike, indicating arm movement associated with reaching for soap–capturing a secondary action that is visually and acoustically ambiguous.

## Audio+Video+ Sensor

adjusting the bike's tire pressure while conversing. The bicycle is parked in a sidewalk and constant changes in IMU data confirms a continuous movement happening in the scene.

Figure 18: Example showcasing multimodal reasoning for fine-grained activity understanding. Given the question “What is the person doing with his bicycle?”, the Audio+Video model identifies that the person is not riding the bicycle and is likely talking nearby. In contrast, the Audio+Video+Sensor model captures continuous IMU fluctuations, suggesting active engagement, such as adjusting the bike’s tire pressure, demonstrating the added interpretive power of sensor input.

Was the person washing dishes or putting the bowl in the sink?

## Audio+Video

The person was washing dishes as evident from the bowl, sink, towel, and bottle. Audio also confirms water running sound in the background. Thus the person is most likely washing dishes.

![](images/98f13c001eb2fdafa55fed19935148804ff14c21cd140564864884170c32c07f.jpg)

## Audio+Video+ Sensor

The person might be washing dishes as sink, bowl, and bottle are present. Imu data confirms some movement likely due to washing dishes. Water running sound also could be heard in the background.

Figure 19: Example illustrating confirmatory reasoning across modalities. Given the question “Was the person washing dishes or putting the bowl in the sink?”, the Audio+Video model infers dishwashing based on visible objects (bowl, sink, towel) and background water sounds. The Audio+Video+Sensor model tries to strengthen this conclusion with IMU evidence from the wrong source, inconsistent with washing actions, reinforcing the activity label through motion-based verification.
