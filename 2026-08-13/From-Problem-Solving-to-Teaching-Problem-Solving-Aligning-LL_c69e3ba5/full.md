## Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) can transform education, but their optimization for direct question-answering often undermines effective pedagogy which requires strategically withholding answers. To mitigate this, we propose an online reinforcement learning (RL)-based alignment framework that can quickly adapt LLMs into effective tutors using simulated student-tutor interactions by emphasizing pedagogical quality and guided problem-solving over simply giving away answers. We use our method to train a 7B parameter tutor model without human annotations which reaches similar performance to larger proprietary models like LearnLM. We introduce a controllable reward weighting to balance pedagogical support and student solving accuracy, allowing us to trace the Pareto frontier between these two objectives. Our models better preserve reasoning capabilities than single-turn SFT baselines and can optionally enhance interpretability through thinking tags that expose the model’s instructional planning.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise in education, particularly as personalized tutors capable of guiding students individually through problems. Recent advances have demonstrated remarkable LLM performance in math and science (Chervonyi et al., 2025; Saab et al., 2024). However, deploying LLMs effectively as educational tutors involves more than excelling on benchmarks (Tack and Piech, 2022; Gupta et al., 2025). To be truly effective, a tutor must facilitate learning by guiding students toward independently constructing correct solutions rather than simply revealing the answers. We refer to this shift from assistant to tutor as pedagogical alignment.

Figure 1: LLM tutoring forms a multi-objective scenario in which LLM tutors should increase the student’s solve rate (y-axis) while minimizing solution leakage (x-axis). Here, the ∆ solve rate measures how often a student can solve a problem before and after the dialog with a tutor and leaked solutions measures how often the tutor tells the solution to the student. Our RL-trained Qwen-2.5-7B models with varying penalty λ are on the Pareto-front and match the performance of specialized closed-source models when tutoring on Big-Math.

Achieving robust pedagogical alignment remains an open challenge (Macina et al., 2025; Maurya et al., 2025). Approaches that rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Daheim et al., 2024; Kwon et al., 2024) can suffer from generalization issues while existing RL-based techniques typically depend on costly, and often proprietary, preference annotations (Team et al., 2024) or require a much larger model as a source of training data of tutor responses (Sonkar et al., 2024; Scarlatos et al., 2025). Due to these limitations, these prior works have largely focused on single-turn feedback, which fails to capture the multi-turn dynamics that are essential for effective tutoring.

Figure 2: Workflow of our RL framework. First, we perform multiple complete student-tutor conversation simulations. After each conversation ends, the reward is computed: 1) post-dialog student solve rate (success) conditioned on the dialog, and 2) the pedagogical quality of the tutor guidance throughout the conversation. This setup uses data from the current tutor model (is on-policy) and does not use offline static dialog data (is online).

To address these gaps, we propose a multi-turn reinforcement learning (RL) method that enables the model to learn directly from its own dialogs with a student to find optimal teaching strategies. Grounded in mastery learning and active teaching principles (Chi and Wylie, 2014; Freeman et al., 2014), our system simulates multi-turn interactions on challenging problems from Big-Math (Albalak et al., 2025), with the tutor LLM using Socratic questioning (Shridhar et al., 2022) and targeted hints instead of handing out solutions. We design reward functions that mirror authentic long-term learning outcomes, namely, how often a student can solve a problem after a dialog with the tutor and how much the tutor follows sound pedagogical principles throughout the full conversation. Our key contributions are the following:

• Cost-efficient training via synthetic student–tutor interactions: Our online RL method replaces the need for expensive human-annotated data with a synthetic data pipeline, enabling a 7B Tutor Model to almost match the performance of LearnLM.

• Controllable pedagogy–accuracy trade-off: Our method enables explicit control over the balance between pedagogical support and student answer correctness by adjusting a penalty weight to navigate a Pareto frontier.

• Preservation of reasoning capabilities: Our approach maintains performance across standard reasoning benchmarks, unlike prior methods such as SocraticLM (Liu et al., 2024). Evaluations on MMLU, GSM8K, and MATH demonstrate that pedagogical alignment does not come at the cost of reasoning ability.

## 2.1 LLMs for Dialog Tutoring

While effective human tutors not only provide answers but more importantly scaffold the learning of students, LLMs are predominantly trained for providing answers which limits their tutoring capabilities (Tack and Piech, 2022; Macina et al., 2023b). Hence, various approaches have been proposed to improve their pedagogical skills.

Arguably the simplest is prompt engineering, where pedagogical criteria are encoded in the prompt, for example, for asking questions (Sonkar et al., 2023; Puech et al., 2025) or detecting mistakes (Wang et al., 2024b) but it is tedious and sensitive to changes (Jurenka et al., 2024).

A more robust alternative is to use gradientbased updating, for example, SFT on teacherstudent dialogs. However, this is challenging because only a few high-quality tutoring datasets exist publicly, for example, MathDial which is semisynthetically created by pairing LLM students with real teachers for solving math problems (Macina et al., 2023a). Hence, many works resort to synthetic data (Wang et al., 2024a). For example, SocraticLM (Liu et al., 2024) is trained on 35k math tutoring dialogs created using a multi-agent setting and TutorChat (Chevalier et al., 2024) is trained using 80k synthetic teacher–student conversations grounded in textbooks. Larger scale approaches in industry, such as, LearnLM (Jurenka et al., 2024) use a mixture of synthetic and human-collected data but this requires substantial resources.

Finally, recent works use Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022), for example, to improve next tutor dialog act prediction (Sonkar et al., 2024) or to improve math tutors by turn-level rewards using GPT-4-generated preference data (Scarlatos et al., 2025). However, it is unclear how single-turn synthetic data translates to tutoring more complex multi-turn conversations.

Prior works treat tutoring as an offline off-policy problem by relying on large-scale synthetic or proprietary data which introduces exposure bias (Ross and Bagnell, 2010; Ranzato et al., 2016) as the tutor does not learn from its own interactions during training. In contrast, our work adopts an online on-policy setup where the model is trained on its own interactions throughout training.

## 2.2 Dialog as RL Task & Verifiable Rewards

Previous work has commonly framed educational dialog as a next teacher utterance generation task, where the teacher’s last turn serves as a ground truth response and the dialog history serves as context (Macina et al., 2023a). However, a dialog is inherently a multi-turn interaction towards a goal (e.g. student learns to solve a problem) and single-turn methods limit the model’s ability to plan across multiple turns to achieve longer-term goals. Effective tutoring, however, is a sequential, adaptive and goal-directed process with the aim of helping a student not only solve a current problem, but also learn to solve similar problems. To address this problem, formulating dialog as an RL problem might be helpful which has been explored outside of tutoring recently (Li et al., 2017; Shani et al., 2024; Xiong et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025).

In general, RL learns optimal actions by collecting a numerical reward from the environment which provides a natural framework for aligning LLM behavior with pedagogical goals by assigning rewards to complete conversations rather than to isolated turns. In LLMs, RL has been successfully used to align with human feedback (Ouyang et al., 2022) and to improve reasoning via verifiable rewards (Shao et al., 2024; Lambert et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025).

Standard on-policy algorithms like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) have been crucial for the success of humanpreference alignment in GPT models. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) (Rafailov et al., 2023) has emerged as a simpler alternative without the requirement of a reward model that allows fine-tuning on offline pairwise preference data. Extensions of DPO to multi-turn settings, such as multi-turn DPO (MDPO), commonly mask user turns to optimize only over assistant responses (Xiong et al., 2025). Recent algorithms such as MTPO (Shani et al., 2024) and REFUEL (Gao et al., 2025) compare pairs of entire conversations rollouts to improve over DPO. Access to verifiable rewards has been crucial for scaling RL training for LLMs, for example, by comparing to a reference solution (Shao et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) or executing programs (Lambert et al., 2025). While these methods have been used to improve reasoning, pedagogical criteria have largely been neglected.

Our work builds upon a line of research formulating a dialog as an RL problem in a synthetic tutor-student environment. By integrating verifiable correctness rewards with pedagogical rubrics, we explore the control of the trade-off between instruction support and answer accuracy.

## 3 Pedagogical Principles

Effective teaching is not only about providing answers but rather about fostering student learning through scaffolding guidance. Here, scaffolding means actively engaging students in problem solving (Chi and Wylie, 2014; Freeman et al., 2014) using questions, hints, and nudges.

Avoiding Answer Leakage: A key element is to actively engage students in problem solving instead of letting them passively consume correct answer, which does not lead to learning. Therefore, we discourage the tutor from presenting complete solutions. Instead, they should guide students through Socratic questioning, hints, or targeted feedback. This mirrors constraints from prior related work, such as the role of a dean persona (Liu et al., 2024).

Helpfulness: The tutor should guide the student with constructive and contextual appropriate support in the right teacher tone. The tutor violates this principle if they provide full answers or dominate the conversation and it is similar to targetedness in prior work (Daheim et al., 2024). Moreover, tutors should be responsive and encouraging, reflecting the tone of real teachers (Tack and Piech, 2022).

## 4 Dialog Tutoring as Multi-Turn RL

We consider multi-turn conversations $\big ( \mathbf { u } _ { 1 } , \dots , \mathbf { u } _ { T } \big )$ made up of a sequence of utterances $\mathbf u _ { t } \in \mathcal V ^ { * }$ taken by either the student or a teacher, both simulated by an LLM. In our training runs, it is decided by random choice who starts the conversation, as detailed in Section 5.1. The goal of the student is to solve a problem $\mathbf { P } \in \mathcal { V } ^ { \ast }$ which has a unique known numerical solution $s \in \mathbb { R }$ . The objective of the LLM tutor is to guide the student toward the solution s by generating a new $\mathbf { u } _ { t }$ given the context $\mathbf { u } _ { < t }$ The conversation ends when the tutor considers it finished or after a fixed number of turns. We use autoregressive LLM-based tutors, parameterized by neural network weights $\theta ,$ to generate outputs by sampling from the model distribution

$$
p _ { \theta } ( \mathbf { u } _ { t } \mid \mathbf { u } _ { < t } ) = \prod _ { n = 1 } ^ { | \mathbf { u } _ { t } | } p _ { \theta } ( [ u _ { t } ] _ { n } \mid [ \mathbf { u } _ { t } ] _ { < n } , \mathbf { u } _ { < t } ) ,
$$

where $[ u _ { t } ] _ { n }$ is the $n \cdot$ -th token of the output sequence $\mathbf { u } _ { t }$ . In Section $^ 3$ we define the pedagogical principles that the generated utterances should fulfill.

Learning $\pmb \theta$ can then also be framed as an RL problem under the lens of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) for which we re-define the previously introduced quantities in common notation. To be precise, for a given position t in the dialog, we define the state to be $\mathbf { s } _ { t } : = \mathbf { u } _ { < t }$ and the action to be $\mathbf { a } _ { t } : = \mathbf { u } _ { t } ,$ i.e. the current state in the conversation is fully captured by the sequence of previous utterances and the action is the next utterance. The transition dynamics are defined by sequentially appending each new utterance (or action) $\mathbf { a } _ { t }$ to the existing conversation history (or state $\mathbf { s } _ { t } )$ to form the new state $\mathbf { s } _ { t + 1 }$ . If $\mathbf { a } _ { t }$ is a tutor utterance, it is sampled from the tutor’s policy; if it is a student utterance, it is sampled from a fixed student LLM conditioned on $\mathbf { s } _ { t }$ . Since the student model is stochastic, the transition dynamics are non-determinsitic from the tutor’s perspective, different from standard RLHF which often assumes deterministic environments.

Then, the goal is to learn the tutor policy $\pi _ { \pmb { \theta } } : =$ $p _ { \pmb { \theta } }$ such that sampled responses

$$
\mathbf { a } _ { t } \sim \pi _ { \pmb { \theta } } ( \cdot \mid \mathbf { s } _ { t } )\tag{1}
$$

fulfill the desiderata in Section 3. We achieve this by defining rewards $r ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } , \mathbf { s } _ { T } )$ that are assigned at the end of a conversation to full sequences a<sub>T</sub> based on the context ${ \bf s } _ { T }$ . That is, we define rewards at the level of the full conversation rather than assigning them to individual turns. Furthermore, we also sample $\mathbf { a } _ { t }$ directly from the current policy $\pi _ { \pmb { \theta } }$ at the given training iteration. The onpolicy approach means we update the current policy $\pi _ { \pmb { \theta } }$ and subsequent dialogs are generated from the newly updated model. This is different from DPObased approaches, which use static data. There, the model is always conditioned on context from an older checkpoint. Instead, we use online RL and avoid such context drift by conditioning on context generated with the current model checkpoint.

## 4.1 Rewarding LLM Tutor Pedagogy

Our reward design follows the pedagogical principles laid out in Section 3. This means that we aim to fulfill two goals: the student should be able to successfully solve P after the dialog and the actions $\mathbf { a } _ { t }$ generated using the policy $\pi _ { \pmb { \theta } }$ should have high pedagogical quality and, for example, not just solve the problem for a student.

We judge solution correctness by sampling multiple final answers ${ \widehat s } ^ { ( 1 ) } , { \widehat s } ^ { ( 2 ) } , \ldots , { \widehat s } ^ { ( \widehat K ) }$ from the stub b bdent model conditioned on aT and sT and compute an empirical expected correctness across these solutions called post-dialog solve rate:

$$
r _ { \mathrm { s o l } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) = \frac { 1 } { K } \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { K } \mathbb { 1 } [ \widehat { s } ^ { ( k ) } = s ] ,\tag{2}
$$

where s is the ground-truth solution, as a verifiable outcome reward (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025).

We judge pedagogical quality (defined in Section 3) using LLM judges $J _ { 1 } , J _ { 2 } , \dots , J _ { M }$ to prevent overfitting on one specific judge model (Coste et al., 2024). We prompt the judge models independently to evaluate the full conversation and then only consider a conversation accepted if all judges accept it by measuring:

$$
r _ { \mathrm { p e d } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) = \prod _ { m = 1 } ^ { M } \mathbb { 1 } [ J _ { m } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } , \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) = \mathop { \mathrm { a c c e p t } } ] .\tag{3}
$$

Altogether, we combine these rewards as:

$$
\begin{array} { r } { r ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) = r _ { \mathrm { s o l } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) \qquad } \\ { + \left( r _ { \mathrm { p e d } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) - 1 \right) \cdot \lambda } \end{array}\tag{4}
$$

given a penalty $\lambda \geq 0$ which is a hyperparameter. The penalty gets subtracted only if any of the pedagogical judges $( r _ { p e d } = 0 )$ do not accept the conversation.

Intuitively, this provides a way of trading off solution correctness indicated by $r _ { \mathrm { s o l } }$ against pedagogy measured by $r _ { \mathrm { p e d } }$ . If we only care about solution correctness, we can choose $\lambda = 0$ but would expect low pedagogy and many answers given away by the tutor. On the other hand, if we send $\lambda  \infty ,$ , only pedagogy matters which might mean that the student solves fewer problems but actually learns how to solve them. In between, various trade-offs can be explored. Finally, we also try a version called hard – if the conversation is not accepted by at least one judge $( r _ { \mathrm { p e d } } = 0 )$ , the overall reward is set to a fixed penalty λ to reflect pedagogical acceptance as a hard prerequisite.

## 5 Experiments

## 5.1 Details on the RL Environment

Our simulated environment is designed to mimic multi-turn interactions between a student and a tutor. Each episode is seeded with the problem P that the student is trying to solve. An overview of the environment and an example of a conversation are in Figure 2. The environment supports two types of common educational interactions which differ in who starts the conversation. One option is to let the LLM student provide an attempted solution which may be correct, incorrect, or partially correct. Then, the tutor continues the conversation based on the initial attempted solution. Another scenario is that the tutor initiates the dialog and elicits a solution from the student LLM. We uniformly sample from the two scenarios in our experiments.

Figure 3: Distribution of problem difficulties in our dataset (solve-rate buckets obtained with our student model Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct). The dataset contains mostly hard (1-10% solve rate) problems. This ensures each item requires meaningful guidance from the tutor model rather than being trivial for our student model.

Furthermore, to enable the tutor model to plan and generate more targeted responses, we adopt thinking tags (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) where the tutor can plan the response. This content is hidden to the student LLM.

## 5.2 Dataset

We evaluate our framework on BigMath (Albalak et al., 2025) which contains multi-step math problems. The dataset is annotated with the solve rate of Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with chain-ofthought prompting (Wei et al., 2022). We only use problems with a single numerical answer and medium-to-high difficulty, i.e., a solve rate by student model between 1% and 60% out of 64 samples. Dataset details are in Table 1 and a distribution over problem difficulties is in Figure 3. We partition this dataset into 10,000 training samples and 500 test samples. On the train dataset, our student model Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct achieves an average pre-dialog solve rate of 25% while Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct achieves 66%.

To evaluate our models, we adopt following test beds:

Held-out BigMath (in-domain): We first report results on the 500 held-out BigMath problems. This mirrors the training setting and verifies whether our RL pipeline optimizes the intended conversational rewards. Our main metrics are the ∆ Solve rate (%) and Leaked Solution (%). ∆ Solve rate (%) measures improvement in the student’s problem-solving success after dialog. It is the difference between pre-dialog solve rate measured using chain-of-thought accuracy and the post-dialog solve rate, with both computed in comparison to the ground truth solution s. Leaked Solution (%) is a portion of conversations where the tutor gives away the solution to the student assessed by an LLM judge (prompt in Figure 14).

Table 1: Composition of training and test datasets with the student model solve rates (pre-dialog).

MathTutorBench (out-of-domain): We additionally evaluate on the independent MathTutor-Bench benchmark (Macina et al., 2025), which provides several automatic metrics for tutor quality. We mainly focus on those metrics that rely on the benchmark’s learned Pedagogical Reward Model (Ped-RM), as they directly reflect the quality of scaffolding and other pedagogical best practices. Note that the Ped-RM score is only used for evaluation across this paper and not as part of the reward.

Reasoning Benchmarks: Finally, to ensure that tutor specialization does not degrade reasoning ability, we also report performance on the general-purpose benchmarks MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and MATH500 (Lightman et al., 2024).

## 5.3 Implementation Details

We use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024) for model optimization. For each problem, we simulate 8 complete student–tutor dialogs (rollouts). A single reward score reflecting student success and pedagogical quality of the entire dialog is assigned at the end of each simulation. We follow the standard GRPO to normalize each dialog reward within each group to obtain dialog-level advantages. The advantages are computed by comparing the reward of a sampled dialog with others in its group. Then dialog-level advantages are propagated to the token-level by adjusting the likelihood of generating each token. We mask the student turns to only optimize over tutor responses. We treat all tutor utterances equally and apply no discounting factor. The maximum number of total turns is set to 16. Moreover, we use a reward for template following based on the success of DeepSeek-AI et al. (2025), see details in Appendix B. To compute $r _ { \mathrm { p e d } }$ , we use two judge prompts: Answer Leakage in Figure 14 and Helpfulness in Figure 15, and sample twice from each.

## 5.4 Models

We use Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to initialize the tutor model and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct as the Student model, following the setup in Big-Math (Albalak et al., 2025). As a judge, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model is used. To avoid overoptimizing on the judge model used during training, in the held-out test set, a judge from another model family is used, namely, Gemma3-27B.

We compare to several tutor baselines: Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct without any fine-tuning, SocraticLM (Liu et al., 2024) as a specialized open-source tutoring model and LearnLM as a specialized close-source tutoring model, GPT-4o-2024-11-20 prompted to behave like a tutor, an SFT model which uses only accepted conversations by the judges for fine-tuning, similar to Macina et al. (2023a), as well as, MDPO (Xiong et al., 2025) which is a multi-turn extension of DPO and is trained on all pairs of chosen and rejected conversations scored by judges, similar to Sonkar et al. (2023); Scarlatos et al. (2025).

## 6 Results

## 6.1 In-Domain Comparison

LLMs prioritize answering over teaching Table 2 presents results across model categories on an in-domain test set. Overall, we observe a trade-off between student success measured by ∆ Solve rate, solution leakage and pedagogical quality, measured by Ped-RM. Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and DeepSeek V3 achieve the highest gains in student solve rate but also exhibit high solution leakage. Qualitative example reveals that models tend to solve the problem directly for the student, see Figure 8. This supports our hypothesis that, even with engineered prompts, standard LLMs are inherently optimized for answering rather than teaching.

Tutoring models show improved pedagogy Specialized tutoring models in Table 2, such as, SocraticLM, SFT, and MDPO demonstrate a more balanced behavior as shown by reduced solution leakage and improved pedagogical scores. However, they often also have lower student success rates, similar to unfinetuned Qwen2.5-7B-

Instruct. The specialized, proprietary tutoring model LearnLM2.0 achieves the highest pedagogical scores while maintaining minimal leakage, indicating strong adherence to pedagogical principles. However, its low ∆ solve rate suggests that it might overpenalize leaking which limits its effectiveness when students require more direct guidance.

Student success and pedagogy are a trade-off Our RL framework enables dynamic control over this trade-off. As shown in Figure 4, increasing the penalty λ reduces solution leakage and improves pedagogical reward, at the cost of student success. Figure 1 shows how various settings of our framework trace a Pareto frontier between student learning gains and pedagogy. At λ = 0.75, for instance, our Qwen2.5-7B-RL model achieves a balanced performance across all three metrics. When λ = 0, the model maximizes student success but does so by leaking answers and scoring negatively on pedagogy. Qualitative comparison in Figure 5 and Figure 6 further reveals that low-pedagogical-penalty models often exploit shortcuts, such as directly stating solutions or using answer fragments (e.g., “ 2+3=? “), even if prompted not to do so. This highlights the importance of our framework when optimizing LLMs as tutors.

Table 3: Performance comparison of tutor models on MMLU, GSM8K, and MATH500 benchmarks, showing the impact of different tutor alignment strategies. SocraticLM is finetuned from Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct and exhibits performance degradation relative to the original model. In contrast, our RL models finetuned from Qwen2.5-7B Instruct demonstrate reduced degradation. Pedagogical-SFT, which applies supervised fine-tuning on data generated by our tutor pipeline, results in noticeable degradation. This highlights the benefits of RL-based alignment.

Large tutoring LLMs can be matched without human annotations Our online RL framing of the multi-turn dialog tutoring task trains tutoring models through interaction with a synthetic student without the need for costly human annotation. It enables scalable, multi-turn optimization with control over pedagogical behaviour via verifiable reward and LLM judge constraints. Table 2 shows that despite using only a 7B model, our RL-tuned models (e.g. with $\lambda = 1 . 5 \mathrm { o r } - r _ { \mathrm { s o l } } )$ outperform specialized closed-source LearnLM models on student solve rates, while nearly matching the solution leakage.

Compared to baselines using fine-tuning via SFT or preference-optimization MDPO (multi-turn extension of DPO), our approach (using λ > 0) achieves lower solution leakage and better tradeoff between tutoring efficacy and student independence. This highlights the value of modeling tutoring as a multi-turn, interactive process rather than using static offline responses.

Thinking tags allow human observability Table 2 shows that the ablation with thinking tags (+think) leads to slightly improved performance as the corresponding model without it. We observe that thinking tags allow the model to solve the problem (Figure 7) or enable the model to plan how to explain mistakes to the student (Figure 9). This is similar to what has been shown to improve model responses in previous work (Daheim et al., 2024), but in our case, the model learns this behaviour during training.

## 6.2 Comparison on the Out-of-Domain Data

No degradation of solving capabilities Unlike prior approaches such as SocraticLM (Liu et al., 2024), which sacrifice base model performance in pursuit of pedagogical alignment, our method preserves reasoning abilities across standard benchmarks. As shown in Table 3, Qwen2.5-7B-RL matches or slightly exceeds the performance of its base model (Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct). In contrast, SocraticLM, which is fine-tuned from the Math version of Qwen, degrades performance. Similarly, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) results in decrease on math-heavy benchmarks (–7.5% on GSM8K, –9.4% on MATH500). These findings demonstrate that RL-based alignment better preserves core reasoning skills, avoiding the trade-off between pedagogical behaviour and task competence.

Out-of-domain tuturing benchmark Table 4 shows evaluation of our models on the out-ofdomain MathTutorBench benchmark (Macina et al., 2025), which assesses tutoring ability on nine tasks and uses the Ped-RM to find win-rate over human teachers. Our RL-aligned 7B models match or exceed the pedagogical quality of baseline models. However, SFT remains a strong baseline for Mistake location and Mistake correction tasks, highlighting the need to carefully combine SFT and RL to build robust tutoring models in the future.

## 7 Conclusion

In this work, we propose methods to align LLMs for pedagogy using reinforcement learning. Our method does not require human annotations beyond initial problem statements and train on the models own context which reduces train and test mismatch. Rewards allow balancing student solving accuracy and pedagogy, which requires strategically withholding information while accuracy could trivially be increased by the tutor leaking the solution. We find that smaller models trained with this approach can match large, proprietary models in various tutoring metrics.

## Limitations

Our online RL approach introduces additional complexity compared to simpler SFT or single-turn pairwise preferences such as DPO. In particular, as known from other RL tasks, the use of model rollouts to simulate interactions with a student introduce variance and can make training potentially unstable or sample-inefficient. Careful implementation is required to maintain stability.

Our current reward focuses on conversation-level rewards, for example enabling to focus on longerterm post-dialog student success. However, truly learning a topic is measured with a delayed posttest on student transfer, i.e. the ability to transfer the learned topic over time. Future work could focus on such more precise but very delayed signal.

All experiments focus on math-based tutoring tasks. While math is a valuable testbed with enough existing datasets, it represents only one STEM subject.

Our approach trains tutoring models using interactions with a single student model only, which may not reflect the diversity of real learners. Incorporating additional student models and different student personas in a prompt could lead to more realistic settings better representing a diversity of real learners and their misconceptions.

All student responses and reward signals in our framework is generated synthetically by sampling from LLMs. While this enables scalable and costefficient training, it has not been validated with real students, which future works can explore, for example the impact of a trade-off between student success and pedagogy.

## Ethics Statement

Intended Usage We will release the code under CC-BY-4.0 license. We use the BigMath, GSM8k, and MATH500 datasets released under the MIT license, the MathTutorBench benchmark released under CC-BY-4.0, and the MMLU with the Apache License 2.0. We use all of the datasets within their intended usage.

Potential Misuse The overall goal of this work is to support the community in improving LLMs at tutoring capabilities and align them with good pedagogical practice based on learning sciences. However, there are potential risks related to the reward function and reward hacking. If the reward function is redefined or an inappropriate penalty is used, the model might learn a suboptimal tutoring behaviour. Similarly, if the reward function is underspecified, the risk of model hacking the reward and finding shortcuts is present. We mitigate this by including several datasets and evaluation setups. Moreover, we share the code, hyperparameters, and the setup openly. However, before deploying the model with real students we emphasize caution, adding safeguards and proper user testing.

## A Implementation Details

## A.1 Compute Resources

All GRPO runs were conducted using 4 A100 80GB GPUs over approximately 48 hours per run. Each run covered roughly 20% of the training data and involved around 300 policy updates. At an estimated cost of \$2 per GPU hour, each full RL training run costs approximately \$400.

## A.2 Configuration

We adapt the standard GRPOTrainer from the TRL library (von Werra et al., 2020) to support our multi-agent tutor-student interaction setting. For each problem instance P, we randomly select one of the two supported tutoring scenarios in our environment—either student-initiated or tutorinitiated—and apply it uniformly across all rollouts in the corresponding batch. To compute the student solve rate, we set $K = 8$ . All dialog rollouts start from an empty dialog history and only problem $P$ as input.

The key hyperparameters are:

• Learning rate: $5 \times 1 0 ^ { - 7 }$

• KL coefficient: $\beta = 0 . 0 0 1$

• Gradient steps per batch: $\mu = 2$

• Batch size: 16 problems per batch, each with 8 rollouts

• Sampling temperature: T = 1.0

We use the paged\_adamw\_8bit optimizer (Dettmers et al., 2022) to reduce memory usage.

## A.3 Baselines: SFT and MDPO

To generate data for the MDPO and SFT baselines, we sample 30% of the full dataset and generate 8 rollouts (conversations) $D = ( \mathbf { u } _ { 1 } , \ldots , \mathbf { u } _ { T } )$ per problem. For MDPO, we construct within-group preference pairs $( D _ { \mathrm { a c c } } , D _ { \mathrm { r e j } } )$ such that $r ( D _ { \mathrm { a c c } } ) >$ $r ( D _ { \mathrm { r e j } } )$ , resulting in 36k preference pairs. For SFT, we filter the MDPO data to keep only accepted responses, remove duplicates, and obtain approximately 14k accepted samples.

Training hyperparameters for baselines:

• SFT: batch size 16, learning rate $2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ trained for 1 epoch

• MDPO: batch size 32, learning rate $2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 7 }$ trained for 1 epoch (all settings follow the original MDPO paper (Xiong et al., 2025))

## A.4 Inference and Quantization

To enable efficient tutor–student–judge simulation at scale, we serve all models through vLLM library (Kwon et al., 2023), which enables fast batched decoding with KV-caching. To reduce memory footprint and inference latency we also employ quantization. The student model is quantized using FP8, enabling fast inference while not noticeably degrading performance. The judge model is quantized using 4-bit Activation-Aware Quantization (AWQ) (Lin et al., 2024), significantly reducing compute cost.

## B Template reward

In addition to the primary pedagogical and correctness rewards, we incorporate several template-based auxiliary rewards inspired by prior work (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025). These rewards encourage structured and concise tutor interactions and penalize incorrect use of format tags and conversation mechanics.

## B.1 Thinking Tag Usage Reward

To promote transparent and interpretable internal reasoning by the tutor, we reward explicitly formatted thinking tags. Each tutor’s turn can include structured reasoning enclosed within tags of the format:

$$
< \mathrm { t h i n k > . ~ . ~ } < / \mathrm { t h i n k > }
$$

We compute the reward as follows:

$$
r _ { \mathrm { t h i n k } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) = c { \times } \frac { \lvert \left\{ \mathbf { u } _ { i } \in D \mid \mathbf { u } _ { i } \mathrm { c o r r e c t } \mathrm { t a g s } \right\} \rvert } { \lvert \left\{ \mathbf { u } _ { i } \in D \right\} \rvert } ,
$$

where $\mathbf { u } _ { i }$ are individual tutor utterances and c is a constant which we set to 0.5. The correct formatting implies that tags are both opened and properly closed without structural errors.

## B.2 Penalty for Incorrect Thinking Tag Formatting

To enforce the correctness of thinking tag formatting and ensure structured output, we penalize the model for each incorrectly formatted or unclosed thinking tag:

$$
p _ { \mathrm { m i s u s e } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) = c \times ( \# \mathrm { o f } \mathrm { w r o n g } \mathrm { t a g s } \mathrm { i n } D ) .
$$

This includes scenarios where:

• A thinking tag is opened but not closed.

• A thinking tag is malformed or incorrectly structured.

## B.3 End-of-Conversation Reward

To encourage the tutor model to efficiently and naturally conclude dialogs, we reward the explicit use of the special termination tag:

$$
\langle { \mathrm { e n d } } \_ { \mathrm { o f } \_ { \mathrm { c o n v e r s a t i o n } } } \rangle
$$

Only the tutor is permitted to terminate the conversation by generating this special token. The reward is defined as:

$$
r _ { \mathrm { e n d } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) = { \left\{ \begin{array} { l l } { 0 . 1 , } & { { \mathrm { i f ~ d i a l o g ~ i s ~ e n d e d ~ e a r l y } } } \\ { 0 , } & { { \mathrm { o t h e r w i s e . } } } \end{array} \right. }
$$

This incentivizes concise, purposeful interactions, discouraging overly long dialogs.

## B.4 Penalty for Exceeding Max Tokens per Turn

We set a maximum number of tokens allowed per tutor turn. If any tutor’s turn exceeds this limit (thus failing to generate the EOS token within the maximum length), we apply a fixed penalty:

$$
p _ { \mathrm { l e n } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) = { \left\{ \begin{array} { l l } { 0 . 5 , \ } & { { \mathrm { n o ~ E O S ~ t o k e n ~ g e n e r a t e d } } } \\ { 0 , \ } & { { \mathrm { o t h e r w i s e . } } } \end{array} \right. }
$$

This penalty ensures the tutor generates concise and complete responses without truncation, promoting conversational coherence.

## B.5 Combined Template Reward

The combined auxiliary reward incorporating all these components is:

$$
\begin{array} { r l } & { r _ { \mathrm { t e m p l } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) = r _ { \mathrm { t h i n k } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) + r _ { \mathrm { e n d } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) } \\ & { ~ - p _ { \mathrm { m i s u s e } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) } \\ & { ~ - p _ { \mathrm { l e n } } ( \mathbf { a } _ { T } \mid \mathbf { s } _ { T } ) . } \end{array}
$$

## C Prompts

Pre-dialog solution by a student is computed using the prompt in Figure 10 and post-dialog solution by a student using the prompt in Figure 11. Student and tutor system prompts used during a conversation are in Figure 12 and Figure 13. The exact prompt for judging the leakage of the solution by a teacher model is in Figure 14 and Figure 15 shows the prompt for the helpfulness of the tutor response.

## D Example Conversations

Examples of the conversations from our model are in Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, and Figure 9.
